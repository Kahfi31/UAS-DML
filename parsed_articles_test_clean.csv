10.1002_anie.201916483,"Abstract The homoleptic pyrazolate complexes [Ce III  4 (Me 2 pz) 12 ] and [Ce IV (Me 2 pz) 4 ] 2 quantitatively insert CO 2 to give [Ce III  4 (Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 12 ] and [Ce IV (Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 4 ], respectively (Me 2 pz=3,5‐dimethylpyrazolato). This process is reversible for both complexes, as observed by in situ IR and NMR spectroscopy in solution and by TGA in the solid state. By adjusting the molar ratio, one molecule of CO 2 per [Ce IV (Me 2 pz) 4 ] complex could be inserted to give trimetallic [Ce 3 (Me 2 pz) 9 (Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 3 (thf)]. Both the cerous and ceric insertion products catalyze the formation of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO 2 under mild conditions. In the absence of epoxide, the ceric catalyst is prone to reduction by the co‐catalyst tetra‐ n ‐butylammonium bromide (TBAB).","Introduction Inexorably rising CO 2 levels in the earth's atmosphere—and their consequential environmental impact—have spurred much interest in combating CO 2 build‐up. 2 conversion into fuels or chemical feedstocks 2 , or overcoming the high activation barrier of CO 2 . 2 sorption capacity ca. 3 mmol g −1 at 1 bar) 2 g −1 at 1 bar). Like alkaline‐earth metals, rare‐earth metals (Ln) feature a high affinity for carbon dioxide (cf. bastnaesite is the most important Ln III deposit in the Earth's crust). Thus, metal‐organic derivatives easily react with or insert CO 2 , as initially demonstrated by Bochkarev et al. for homoleptic silylamides Ln[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 3  n Bu) 3 ] (Scheme Irreversible reaction of carbon dioxide with archetypal organo‐rare‐earth‐metal complexes, with the exception of (e) as shown for (C 5 Me 5 ) 2 Sm(SePh)(thf). Similar archetypes (including Ln III aryloxides) can also be used for chemical transformations, such as the catalytic conversion of a CO 2 /epoxide mixture into cyclic carbonates 2 insertion or favor additional transformations through CO 2 post‐activation (e.g. formation of CO, CO 3  2− , C 2 O 4  2− ). 2 activation. IV oxo complex [(L OEt ) 2 Ce=O(H 2 O)]⋅MeC(O)NH 2 (L OEt  − =[Co(η 5 ‐C 5 H 5 ){P(O)(OEt) 2 } 3 ] − ) was shown to form the tetravalent carbonate species [(L OEt ) 2 Ce(CO 3 )], ortho ‐NHC‐substituted aryloxide Ce III complexes (NHC=N‐heterocyclic carbene) insert CO 2 into the Ce−C NHC bond in a semireversible manner, and catalytically form propylene carbonate from propylene oxide. Bulky cyclopentadienyl (Cp) derivatives (e.g. Ln(C 5 Me 5 ) 3 ) were shown to accommodate CO 2 insertion in a unidirectional manner, thereby forming very stable carboxylato moieties through a η 5 ‐to‐η 1 switch in the C 5 Me 5 coordination (cf. Scheme 2 bond may tolerate a more reversible insertion process, as seen for other CO 2 ‐heteroatom bonds (Scheme 2 pz) 4 ] 2 complex was recently shown to undergo reversible insertion of ketones into the Ce−N bond, 2 . Quantitative insertion of CO 2 into the Ce−N(Me 2 pz) bond was observed for both tetravalent and trivalent cerium Me 2 pz complexes, and intriguingly the insertion process was found to be fully reversible.

Results and Discussion  Carbon Dioxide Insertion into a Ceric Pyrazolate : Treatment of [Ce(Me 2 pz) 4 ] 2 ( 1 ) with excess CO 2 in either toluene or thf (under 1 bar CO 2 pressure) led to a color change from dark red to orange within 5 minutes (Scheme 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 4 ] with either toluene ( 2⋅toluene , 54 %) or thf ( 2⋅thf , 64 %) within the lattice. Discounting the lattice solvent, this accounts for about 25 wt % CO 2 or 5.7 mmol CO 2 per gram. Insertion of CO 2 into the Ce−N(Me 2 pz) bond of [Ce(Me 2 pz) 4 ] 2 at: a) −40 °C in thf or b) ambient temperature in toluene. The molecular structure of 2⋅toluene revealed an 8‐coordinate cerium(IV) center with four κ 2 ( N , O )‐coordinating Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligands (Figure 2 ( O , O ) modes in carboxylates and related carbamates. The Ce−N and Ce−O bond lengths average 2.528 Å and 2.255 Å, respectively, thus matching the values found in the benzophenone‐inserted product [Ce(Me 2 pz) 2 (pdpm) 2 ] (Ce1−N1 2.564 Å, Ce1−O1 2.173 Å; pdpm=(3,5‐dimethylpyrazol‐1‐yl)diphenylmethanolate). IV complexes, [Ce(L) 4 ] (with L as a donor‐functionalized alkoxy ligand engaged in a 5‐membered chelate to cerium), also have similar Ce−O bond lengths as those in 2 , thus highlighting a common chelating coordination motif. 2⋅toluene and 2⋅thf , which showed the presence of a strong absorption band at =1732 and 1718 cm ν ˜ −1 , respectively, for the CO stretching of the C−O double bond as well as a strong absorption band at =1336 cm ν ˜ −1 for the CO stretching of the C−O single bond.

Selected bond lengths/angles are listed in the Supporting Information. The structure was also supported by NMR spectroscopic measurements. The 1 H NMR spectrum recorded in [D 8 ]toluene at ambient temperature revealed two distinct methyl group environments for all the pyrazolato ligands, indicative of ligand asymmetry and complete consumption of [Ce(Me 2 pz) 4 ] 2 . The 13 C signal of the inserted CO 2 was detected at δ =149.9 ppm, a region where pyrazolate N‐CO 2 R signals are expected. 1 H NMR measurements on 2⋅thf in [D 8 ]THF at ambient temperature showed a mixture of products, which could not be assigned. Cooling the solution to −40 °C under 1 bar CO 2 pressure led to a color change from red to orange and both the 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra recorded at −40 °C showed similar signals as 2⋅toluene in [D 8 ]toluene. Variable‐temperature (VT) NMR studies of 2⋅toluene and 2⋅thf in [D 8 ]toluene and [D 8 ]THF were conducted to investigate the reversibility of CO 2 insertion (Scheme 8 ]toluene, the formation of a new species at 40 °C was revealed and no further liberation of CO 2 was observed even after heating above 60 °C (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The 1 H NMR spectrum recorded at 40 °C shows two sets of signals for different Me 2 pz moieties in a 1:1 ratio, which suggests the formation of putative compound [Ce(Me 2 pz) 2 (Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 2 ]. Reversible insertion of CO 2 into the Ce−N(Me 2 pz) bond. The process is completely reversible in [D 8 ]thf and partially reversible in [D 8 ]toluene. The product arising from the elimination of CO 2 in [D 8 ]toluene has not been isolated; the structure is based on 1 H NMR spectroscopic analysis at 40 °C. Recooling the solution did not reform 2⋅toluene quantitatively, likely because some of the liberated CO 2 was no longer within the reaction medium, but the addition of fresh CO 2 quantitatively reformed 2⋅toluene . The [D 8 ]THF VT NMR experiment of compound 2⋅thf showed a different CO 2 ‐deinsertion behavior (see Figure S10). As a consequence of competitive thf coordination, displacement of CO 2 starts at 10 °C and is complete at 60 °C, with formation of [Ce(Me 2 pz) 4 (thf)]. As seen in the experiment in [D 8 ]toluene, this reaction is fully reversible by recooling the sample and subsequently introducing CO 2 . Additionally, in situ IR measurements were performed at 60 °C, which showed complete loss of inserted CO 2 and formation of free CO 2 (Figure In situ IR spectroscopy of 2⋅thf at 60 °C in the range of =1700 to 2350 cm ν ˜ −1 . Normalized intensities are shown. Spectra were recorded every minute. In the solid state, 2⋅toluene is stable for several weeks at −40 °C, but at ambient temperature it partially loses CO 2 over a few days or when it is exposed to vacuum, as indicated by a color change from orange to dark red. A thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), performed under a flow of Ar and heating the sample slowly from 28 °C to 250 °C, indicated an initial loss of mostly lattice toluene. The liberation of CO 2 and small amounts of lattice toluene was dominant between 55 and 95 °C, as revealed by a step of 21.92 % (theoretical proportion of CO 2 in 2⋅toluene 19.98 %). At 250 °C, only nonvolatile parts of 2⋅toluene remain, leaving a mass of 49.79 % of the initial weight (theoretical value 51.61 %; see Figure S59). Although the deinsertion of carbon dioxide was achieved in the solid state, bulk compound 1 did not insert any carbon dioxide when stored under 1 bar CO 2 pressure for three days. Moreover, compound 1 was hydrolyzed upon exposure to air within one hour (DRIFT spectrum, see Figure S57). [Ce(Me 2 pz) 4 (thf)] ( 1‐thf ) was treated with stoichiometric amounts of CO 2 to generate the putative [Ce(Me 2 pz) 2 (Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 2 ] (Scheme 3 (Me 2 pz) 9 (Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 3 (thf)] ( 3 ) in moderate yields of 46 % (Scheme 3 shows a ring motif with two distinct 9‐coordinate and one 10‐coordinate cerium atoms (Figure 2 pz ligands in an η 2 ( N , N ′) fashion, Ce1 connects further to two oxygen atoms of neighboring Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligands as well as an additional thf molecule, 10‐coordinate Ce2 is surrounded by two κ 2 :( N , O )‐chelating Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligands, and Ce3 exhibits additional contacts to one κ 2 :( N , O )‐Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligand and an oxygen atom of a neighboring Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligand.

Selected bond lengths/angles are listed in the Supporting Information. Insertion of one equivalent of CO 2 into the Ce−N(Me 2 pz) bond of [Ce(Me 2 pz) 4 (thf)]. Each Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligand bridges between two cerium atoms. In contrast to homoleptic 2 , all the oxygen atoms are engaged in cerium bonding, which implies delocalized O−C−O bonds (av. C−O, 1.247 Å). The η 2 ( N , N ′)‐Ce−N(Me 2 pz) bond lengths are in the expected range. 8 ]toluene, the trimetallic entity 3 is retained in solution at low temperatures, with every dimethylpyrazolato ligand showing a distinct signal set in the proton NMR spectrum at −80 °C (see Figure S12). The signals for the protons of the bridging Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligands are shifted upfield compared to those of the terminal η 2 ( N , N′ )‐Me 2 pz ligands. As a consequence of the equilibrium between potential alternative oligomers formed in the presence of only one equivalent of CO 2 per cerium, the interpretation of the ambient‐temperature NMR spectrum was difficult. This was already experienced for the insertion of benzophenone into the Ce−N(Me 2 pz) bond. 2 was liberated and [Ce(Me 2 pz) 4 ] re‐formed (see Figure S14). After cooling to ambient temperature, a partial reinsertion of CO 2 was observed, as was found in the VT NMR experiments on 2⋅toluene and 2⋅thf .  Carbon Dioxide Insertion into a Cerous Pyrazolate : To examine the role of the oxidation state of cerium (Ce IV versus Ce III ) and, therefore, the impact of its Lewis acidity, cerous donor‐free [Ce 4 (Me 2 pz) 12 ] 4 ) was used as a precursor for CO 2 insertion (Scheme 4 nuclearity, all of the Ce−N(Me 2 pz) moieties engaged in CO 2 insertion, leading to the complex [Ce 4 (Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 12 ] ( 5 ; Figure 4 , 5 revealed only three. Ce2, Ce3, and Ce4 form a nearly equilateral triangle bridged by μ 3 ‐1κ 2 ( N , O ):2κ( O ):3κ( O ′)‐Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 . Each of the 9‐coordinate cerium centers (Ce2, Ce3, and Ce4) is also surrounded by two terminal Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 groups in a κ 2 ( N , O ) coordination mode and two oxygen atoms in a κ 2 ( O , O ′) fashion (Figure S66). This triangle is capped by 9‐coordinate Ce1, which is coordinated to three Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligands in a κ 2 ( N , O ) manner (Ce1−N avg 2.710 Å, Ce1−O avg 2.395 Å) and to three bridging oxygen atoms. The Ce−O bond lengths are similar to those found in [Ce(L R ⋅CO 2 ) 3 ] (L R =2‐ O ‐3,5‐ t Bu 2 ‐C 6 H 2 (1‐C{N(CH) 2 N(R)}) and R= i Pr and Mes) reported by Arnold et al. with Ce−O bond lengths of 2.466(6)–2.482(6) Å. 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligands, with two C−O bond lengths in the same region (1.235(9)–1.264(9) Å) and rather localized C−O single (1.26(1)–1.301(9) Å) and C−O double bonds (1.21(1)–1.229(9) Å) for the capping and terminal Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligands. For further comparison, the cerous carbamate [Ce 4 (O 2 CN i Pr 2 ) 12 ] features a lozenged arrangement of one 8‐coordinate and three 7‐coordinate Ce III centers with Ce−O bond lengths in the range 2.322(7)–2.746(7)  Å (no Ce‐N interaction). 3 (DME) with HN i Pr 2 and CO 2 (Scheme 5 , DRIFTS measurements show strong absorption bands for both the C−O single bonds ( =1250–1350 cm ν ˜ −1 ) and C−O double bonds ( =1600–1750 cm ν ˜ −1 ). 1 H DOSY NMR measurements on 5 in [D 8 ]toluene, [D 8 ]THF, or a [D 8 ]toluene/3,3‐dimethyl‐1,2‐butylene oxide mixture revealed distinct diffusion coefficients (see Figures S17–S20) for the solvents employed and only one additional peak corresponding to a much larger species but correlating with every other signal in the proton NMR spectra. Calculation of the molar mass of this compound ([D 8 ]toluene: M =1989 g mol r −1 ; [D 8 ]THF: M =1643 g mol r −1 ; [D 8 ]toluene + 3,3‐dimethyl‐1,2‐butyleneoxide: M =2357 g mol r −1 ) as a compact sphere‐like molecule M =2242 g mol r −1 ) or a non‐monometallic species in solution. Treating [Ce(Me 2 pz) 3 (thf)] 2 with CO 2 in [D 8 ]THF gave the same NMR spectrum as that of 5⋅toluene , thus indicating the formation of a multimetallic compound also in donor solvents (see Figure S16). TGA of 5⋅toluene also showed an initial loss of toluene (cf. 2⋅toluene ), followed by a pronounced step (21.39 % weight loss) in the range from 52 to 90 °C, consistent with the release of CO 2 (theoretical value: 16.75 %) and some lattice toluene (Figure S60). At 250 °C, only the nonvolatile parts of 5⋅toluene remain and a total loss of 46.82 wt % compared to the starting material fits well with the theoretical value of 45.99 % for 10 molecules of toluene and 12 molecules of CO 2 eliminated from [Ce 4 (Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 12 ]⋅10 toluene ( 5⋅toluene ).

Insertion of of CO 2 into the Ce−N(Me 2 pz) bonds of cerous [Ce 4 (Me 2 pz) 12 ].  Catalytic Formation of Cyclic Carbonates from CO : Having established the efficiency and reversibility of CO 2 and Oxiranes 2 insertion into Ce−N(Me 2 pz) bonds, we were interested in any catalytic utilization. Accordingly, pyrazolate complexes 1 and 4 were probed as catalysts for the generation of cyclic carbonates from CO 2 and oxiranes. In the absence of CO 2 , compound 1 interacts with epoxides, as indicated by a noticeable shift in the 1 H NMR spectrum upon addition of one equivalent of 3,3‐dimethyl‐1,2‐butylene oxide (see Figure S24). This is most likely due to formation of a donor adduct, which is considered a crucial step in Lewis‐acid‐catalyzed cycloaddition reactions. Even though such donor adducts were shown to be isolable (e.g. Tp Ca(O‐2,6‐ t Bu i Pr 2 C 6 H 3 )⋅(PO); Tp =tris(3‐ t Bu t Bu‐pyrazolyl)borato, PO=propylene oxide 2 pz) 4 (PO)] ( 1‐PO ) could not be isolated. Tetra‐ n ‐butylammonium bromide (TBAB) was employed as a co‐catalyst, since it was shown to promote the highest activities in such cycloaddition reactions. 1 or 0.25 mol % 4 and 1 mol % TBAB without solvent at ambient temperature and 1 bar CO 2 pressure gave 93 % conversion for the tetravalent catalyst 1 and 98 % for its trivalent counterpart (Table 2 ‐insertion complexes 2 and 5 displayed similar catalytic activity (entries 2 and 4). The conversion dropped drastically on increasing the steric bulk of the substituent on the epoxides. As a result, styrene oxide, and 3,3‐dimethyl‐1,2‐butylene oxide showed only very low conversions (entry 21) for ceric 1 and almost no conversion in the case of trivalent catalyst 4 (entry 22). Moderate conversion was observed for 1,2‐ n ‐hexylene oxide with the tetravalent catalyst 1 (entry 13). Conducting the catalysis at higher temperature increased the TONs with both catalysts 1 and 4 , and resulted in nearly quantitative conversion for both systems (entries 15 and 16). Without co‐catalyst TBAB, 1 showed moderate catalytic activity at 90 °C (entry 17). In almost all cases, tetravalent 1 showed higher catalytic activity than cerous 4 , which most likely results from the higher Lewis acidity of Ce IV versus Ce III . To further evaluate the catalytic reaction with catalyst 1 and propylene oxide, the TOFs at different stages of the catalysis were determined (see Table S1). After a short induction period, most likely corresponding to the insertion of CO 2 into 1 , the TOF reached a maximum of 11 h −1 within the first 3 h. For comparison, a TOF of 155 h −1 was reported by Yao and co‐workers when performing the reaction under 10 bar CO 2 pressure. 2 pressure did not significantly affect the catalytic activity of compound 1 (entries  13 vs. 18 and 21 vs. 23). However, a simultaneous increase of the temperature to 90 °C and the CO 2 pressure to 10 bar led to a marked improvement in the catalytic activity, resulting in TONs of up to 300 for the sterically demanding 3,3‐dimethyl‐1,2‐butylene oxide (entries 24 and 26). The latter conditions were also applicable for the cycloaddition of CO 2 and cyclohexene oxide, an internal epoxide (entries 27–29). Having optimized the reaction conditions, we determined the initial turnover frequencies for the different epoxides (entries 5, 12, 20, and 25). As expected, the TOFs increased as the steric of the substituents bulk decreased, ranging from 24 to 196 h −1 and giving almost quantitative conversion of propylene oxide after a reaction time of one hour (entry 5). Compared to the other catalyst systems based on rare‐earth metals reported by Yao and co‐workers (TOFs up to 440 h −1 ) or by Otero and co‐workers (3167 h −1 ), our system shows only moderate catalytic activity under comparable conditions.

KGaA The mechanism of the cycloaddition of CO 2 and epoxides using tetraalkylammonium salts as co‐catalysts has been discussed in detail. 2 and cyclizes to produce a cyclic carbonate. Hints that the mechanisms for the cycloaddition differ using ceric 1 or cerous 4 as the catalyst could be found when conducting the reactions with different amounts of catalyst loading (entries 7 and 9). This results in a change in the TONs for the tetravalent catalyst 1 , whereas the TONs remained the same for trivalent complex 4 . The occurrence of distinct reaction mechanisms is not surprising, as 1 is a monometallic complex while 4 is a tetrametallic compound in the solid state and in solution (for a more detailed possible mechanism see Scheme S1). Such a mechanism, involving multiple metal centers, was previously proposed for the bimetallic complex [Al(salen)] 2 O by North and co‐workers. Proposed overall mechanism for the coupling of CO 2 with epoxides. Complex 2 underwent a reductive side reaction in the presence of TBAB to afford cerous species [Ce(Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ) 4 ][NBu 4 ] ( 6 ). This side reaction occurred during the catalytic studies and when combining 1 and TBAB in stoichiometric amounts in [D 8 ]toluene under 1 bar CO 2 pressure. Although 2 is very stable in toluene solution under these conditions (no color change was observed after several days), it underwent reduction in the presence of TBAB within hours, as evidenced by decolorization of the orange solution. Most probably bromine is formed as an oxidation product; however, no brominated product could be detected in the reaction mixture (see Figure S23). The use of epoxides as a solvent seems to stabilize the tetravalent 2 , as no paramagnetic signals were found in the 1 H NMR spectra of the catalytic reactions. The crystal structure of 6 revealed the same motif as seen in 2⋅toluene and 2⋅thf (see Figure S67). The 8‐coordinate cerium center bears four κ 2 ( N , O ) Me 2 pz⋅CO 2 ligands with elongated Ce−N and Ce−O bonds compared to ceric 2⋅toluene and 2⋅thf , as would be expected for a cerium(III) center. Cerous 6 displays poor catalytic activity compared to tetravalent 1 (Table

Conclusion We have shown that carbon dioxide easily inserts into the Ce−N(Me 2 pz) bond of both ceric [Ce(Me 2 pz) 4 ] 2 and cerous [Ce 4 (Me 2 pz) 12 ] at an amount equivalent to 5.7 mmol CO 2 per gram complex and via the controlled activation of 12 molecules of CO 2 within one complex, respectively. The insertion process is reversible both in solution and in the solid state, with CO 2 desorption being complete at <100 °C. Both trivalent and tetravalent cerium pyrazolate complexes are active catalysts for the cycloaddition of epoxides and carbon dioxide with TBAB as a co‐catalyst under mild conditions. We are currently investigating the carbon dioxide capture performance of silica‐grafted variants of Ce‐pyrazolates, 2 ‐“breathable”/expandable MOFs.

The aluminate trapps carbonyls by the formation of C−C and Al−O bonds, but the products maintain full reversibility and outstanding dynamic exchange rates. Remarkably, the C−C bonds can be formed or cleaved by the addition or removal of lithium cations, permitting unprecedented control over the system's constitutional state. Moreover, the metal‐ligand cooperative substrate interaction allows to twist the kinetics of catalytic hydroboration reactions in a unique sense.

Results and Discussion Exposing [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] to 2 bar CO 2 in dichloromethane at room temperature resulted in a color change from colorless to yellow within seconds. The 1 H NMR spectrum revealed a clean and quantitative reaction. Strongly downfield‐shifted signals of two pyrrolic protons indicate the dearomatization of one pyrrole unit (Figure D  2 ‐symmetry of [ d 1 ] − is lowered to C , resulting in eight chemically inequivalent pyrrolic and methyl positions. Yellow crystals suitable for SCXRD analysis were obtained from a dichloromethane/toluene/THF solution at room temperature. The measurements illustrate the structure of [PPh 1 4 ][ 1* ‐CO 2 ] (Figure * designates a dearomatized state of one pyrrole unit in the ligand). Binding of CO 2 occurs in a bidentate fashion by the formation of a C−C bond (155.8(6) pm) and Al−O bond (184.8(3) pm). The Al−O bond is in the range of other higher coordinated aluminum centres, 3 ‐sp 2 C−C single bonds. 2 into polar metal‐nitrogen bonds, A) Synthesis of [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐CO 2 ] with in situ 1 H NMR spectra of the pyrrole region.

Although calix[4]pyrroles have been extensively studied as ligands for transition metals, this mode of reactivity was observed only with Ti IV and has not been followed any further. 2 with transition metal complexes. Appealed by the ease and purity of this reaction, [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] was subjected to cyclohexane carboxaldehyde (CyA), para ‐methylbenzaldehyde ( p Me‐BA) and para ‐nitrobenzaldehyde ( p NO 2 ‐BA) under analog conditions as for CO 2 . Quantitative conversions to the 1,2‐addition products were detected by 1 H NMR spectroscopy immediately after aldehyde addition showing similar spectroscopic features of a dearomatized ligand pyrrole unit (Figure 4 ][ 1* ‐CyA], [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐ p NO 2 ‐BA] and [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐ p Me‐BA] for SCXRD were obtained from saturated dichloromethane/toluene solutions at room temperature. Generally, those structures illustrate the same 1,2‐carboalumination pattern as for CO 2 (Figure O ‐bonds (Al‐O distances [pm]: [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐CyA]: 176.7(2), [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐ p MeBA]: 179.0(2), [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐ p NO 2 BA]: 180.0(1)) and the C−C bonds slightly elongated (C−C distances [pm]: [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐CyA]: 159.9(3), [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐ p MeBA]: 159.6(4), [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐ p NO 2 BA]: 160.1(2)). All adducts exhibit Al‐N distances in a range of 189–196 pm for the aromatic pyrroles but elongated dative Al−N bonds (Al‐N dearom .=197–199 pm) for the dearomatized pyrrole rings. During the addition process, the formation of diastereomers was observed. All stereochemical aspects are discussed in section 12.2 of the supporting information.

Given the formation of enthalpically strong C−C and Al−O bonds and the liberation of a square‐planar aluminum center from its unique coordination environment, one would expect tight and irreversible binding of the substrates considered so far. However, in all cases, full reversibility of the addition process was observed. Adding 2 bar of CO 2 to a 13 C‐labeled adduct [Li(thf) ][ n 1* ‐ 13 CO 2 ] in dichloromethane resulted in a smooth exchange of 13 CO 2 over 18 h at room temperature, again in close similarity with PNN‐ or PNP complexes of Ru II or Re I (Figure 2 was readily replaced by the addition of most aldehydes to [ 1* ‐CO 2 ] − , yielding the aldehyde adducts in a remarkable purity (Figure p NO 2 ‐BA quantitatively replaces p Me‐BA from [ 1* ‐ p Me‐BA] − (for a full list of substrate replacement assays, see Table S1). Generally, aldehydes with lower resonance stabilization energy of the C=O bonds (electron‐poor aromatics) para ‐dimethylaminobenzaldehyde ( p DMA‐BA) binds weaker to [ 1 ] − . Upon mixing [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] and p DMA‐BA in dichloromethane at room temperature, broad signals were observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum, pointing on a fast exchange on NMR timescale. Only by cooling this solution to −25 °C, signals for the 1,2‐adduct developed (Figure S4). Besides, other adduct forms were observed at low temperature, that will become of importance during the mechanistic studies of the process (vide infra).

C) Selected 1 H EXSY cross signals for a mixture of [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐CyA] and CyA; mixing time 400 ms, 295 K. Next, we inspected the kinetics of the aldehyde‐aldehyde exchange process in detail. The substitution of p Me‐BA by adding p NO 2 ‐BA to [ 1* ‐ p Me‐BA] − proceeded in <1 ms at −80 °C in dichloromethane and its kinetics were not even measurable with a stopped‐flow UV/Vis‐setup. However, such high reaction rates enable studies by dynamic NMR spectroscopy. Indeed, a mixture of CyA and [PPh 4 ][ 1* ‐CyA] revealed self‐exchange detectable by phase‐sensitive EXSY‐NMR spectroscopy in CD 2 Cl 2 (Figure −1 at 298.15 K, a value for Δ G  ≠ =79.4 kJ mol −1 was obtained and found in good agreement with DFT calculations of the rate‐determining step for the overall process (see computational section). An even lower barrier is demarcated by the broad signals and fast exchange regime with p DMA‐BA at room temperature (Δ G  ≠ <50 kJ mol −1 ), as described above. EXSY‐measurements with varying aldehyde concentrations revealed no effect on the reaction rate (Figure S13). This is an important finding, as it allowed us to characterize the process as dissociative and legitimates the neglect of associative pathways in the computational evaluation. Overall, these systems undergo the fastest reversible carbon‐carbon bond formation reactions ever determined, surpassing even the most rapid Diels Alder reactions with highly activated diene/dienophile combinations. After having obtained the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the binding process, further mechanistic insights were collected. The 1,2‐adduct formation can be conceived either as a step‐wise Al−O=C−R σ‐adduct formation/C−C bond formation or as a concerted process. First, the low‐temperature NMR spectroscopic results of the mixture of [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] and p DMA‐BA were reconsidered. As mentioned above, besides the 1,2‐adduct, other species were observed at −25 °C. The apparent solution state symmetry of the second principal component indicated a local C  2 symmetry at the [ v 1 ] − entity, known from our previous studies with pure σ‐donors (Figure S5). 4 ][ 1 ] with acetone led to broad 1 H NMR signals, similar to the p DMA‐BA case (Figure S3). The characteristic signals of a σ‐adduct and the formation of the 1,2‐adducts occurred at a lower temperature (−50 °C). Noteworthy, this latter reaction disclosed that the reversible carbonyl binding is not restricted to aldehydes but holds likewise for ketones. By using formamide or dimethylformamide as substrates with even larger resonance stabilization energy of the C=O bond, the σ‐adduct formation was readily observed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S20), but the 1,2‐adduct formation did not occur. Having collected sufficient spectroscopic evidence, we were pleased to obtain unambiguous proof for the σ‐adducts also by SCXRD analysis. Computational Section After having spotted the participation of σ‐adducts, quantum‐theoretical studies gained a further understanding. For all substrates, the full reaction path, including σ‐adduct, the final 1,2‐adduct, and the corresponding transition states, were identified at the PW6B95‐D3(BJ), COSMO‐RS(CH 2 Cl 2 )/def2‐QZVPP//PBEh‐3c level of theory (Figure 1 H NMR spectroscopy. In agreement with the experiment, the σ‐adduct between acetone and [ 1 ] − was found as a global minimum at (Δ G =−5.9 kJ mol −1 ), with the 1,2‐adduct lying higher in energy (Δ G =23.1 kJ mol −1 ). The reaction barrier to the σ ‐adduct is caused by the bending of the calix[4]pyrrolato ligand during the entrance of the carbonyl in the coordination sphere of the planar aluminate [ 1 ] − . The formation of the C−C bond and the dearomatization of one pyrrole unit provokes the second reaction barrier.

B) Intrinsic bond orbital representation of the 1,2‐adduct formation process for acetone with emphasis on the dearomatization. They nicely illustrate the transformation of the aromatic pyrrole bond (blue IBO) into the C−C σ‐bond and the dearomatization of the pyrrole ring. A comparison of the thermodynamics and reaction barriers for all substrates was accomplished next (Figure p NO 2 ‐BA, no stable σ‐adduct was found on the PES. The 1,2‐adducts of CyA and p Me‐BA are almost thermoneutral to each other. In line with that, it was observed experimentally that a mixture of [PPh4][ 1* ‐ p Me‐BA] and CyA immediately developed a dynamic mixture of [PPh4][ 1* ‐CyA], [PPh4][ 1* ‐ p Me‐BA], free CyA and free p Me‐BA (Figure S39). Generally, the first reaction barriers for the σ‐adduct formation (Δ G  ≠  TS1 ) do not differ significantly between the various substrates. Surprisingly, they are higher as for the C−C bond formation step (Δ G  ≠  TS2 ), confirming the experimental non‐observability of the σ‐adduct intermediates for most cases. Importantly, for all aldehydes, two diastereomeric σ‐adducts and 1,2‐adducts have to be considered (a full discussion can be found in the supporting information, section 12.2). To conclude, the computed thermodynamics of the reaction products and intermediates ideally match with the experimental product distributions and the calculated reaction barriers are in good agreement with the experimentally derived values (e.g., for CyA: Δ G  ≠  exp =79.4 kJ mol −1 /Δ G  ≠  comp =63.7 kJ mol −1 ). Influence of the Countercation—Providing a Trigger for C−C Bond Formation and Catalytic Reaction Control The previous sections clarified the binding of carbonyls with the [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] system. Now, the influence of the counteraction to [ 1 ] − was studied. Cases in which the σ ‐adduct formation with [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] was favored were of particular interest. The addition of lithium iodide to the σ ‐adduct of p DMA‐BA with [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] in [D 2 ]dichloromethane induced the quantitative transformation to the 1,2‐adducts (Figure A) Locking of the 1,2‐adducts by addition of a soluble Li + salt and unlocking by addition of 12‐crown‐4.

In the p NO 2 ‐BA curves, the slow background reaction was subtracted. In addition to NMR spectroscopy, this behavior was validated by SCXRD analysis of [Li(thf) 2 ][ 1* ‐ p DMA‐BA] (Figure + is η 5 ‐coordinated to an aromatic pyrrole ring and bridges to the oxygen atom of the bound CO moiety. The Al−O and C−C bond lengths are similar to the spontaneously formed 1,2‐adducts, shown in Figure σ ‐adduct of [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] and acetone or cyclopentanone upon the addition of lithium iodide or use of [Li‐(thf) 4 ][ 1 ‐thf] (for SCXRD see SI and Figures S13–S16). Strikingly, the lithium ion‐induced C−C bond formation can be reversed. After the addition of 12‐crown‐4 as a complexation agent for Li + , the original broad signals of the σ ‐adducts reappear in the 1 H NMR spectrum. By the addition of further lithium iodide, the process can be repeated (Figure S21). Quantum chemical calculations fully supported our observations. The coordination of a [Li‐dme] + fragment to the [ 1 *‐carbonyl] adducts leads to a computed stabilization of the 1,2‐adduct by 20–70 kJ mol −1 (Figure S104). In the case of acetone and p DMA‐BA, this effect indeed turns the process from endergonic to exergonic. Hence, the addition of a lithium cation offers quantitative yet reversible control over the formation of a C−C bond . Such a straightforward and mild trigger is, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented. Given the very clean reaction outcome, achievable within seconds by merely combining easy to handle crystalline solids, it constitutes a triggerable reversible click reaction . Eager to identify a model catalytic application that is influenced by the MLC binding mode of [ 1 ] −  , the hydroboration of aldehydes with pinacolborane was probed (Figure p NO 2 ‐BA undergoes slow hydroboration already in the absence of a catalyst (Figure S46), but the other considered C=O containing substrates were unreactive without a catalyst under the given conditions (Figures S48/51). However, in the presence of 0.05 mol % of [PPh 4 ][ 1 ], all compounds were catalytically hydroborated. Although not competing with the most efficient hydroboration catalysts, With 0.05 mol % of [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] in [D 8 ]THF, p DMA‐BA is hydroborated only slowly (20 % conversion after 2 h, Figure 4 ][ 1 ‐thf] as the catalyst, the efficiency is boosted dramatically, and the reaction went to completion within 20 min under the same conditions (dark blue curve). The role of lithium cations as the catalytically active species was ruled out by employing 0.1 mol % LiOTf or LiI (without [ 1 ] − ), in which case no reaction occurred (Figure S54). For acetone, a more than 50‐fold increase in reaction rate was observed between [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] (dotted yellow curve) and [Li(thf) 4 ][ 1 ‐thf] (thick yellow curve). Thus, with 0.05 mol % of the [Li(thf) 4 ][ 1 ‐thf] catalyst system in [D 8 ]THF, remarkable TOFs of >4500 h −1 for p DMA‐BA and 2000 h −1 for acetone were achieved. In [D 2 ]dichloromethane as a solvent, even a >100‐fold rate increase was noted (Figure S42). In stark contrast, a much less pronounced increase of the reaction rate for the catalyzed hydroboration of p NO 2 ‐BA happened with [Li(thf) 4 ][ 1 ‐thf] in comparison to [PPh 4 ][ 1 ] (Figure p NO 2 ‐BA forms the 1,2‐adduct with both salts of [ 1 ] − . Since the 1,2‐bound states in d ‐block MLC‐catalysis represent resting states, p DMA‐BA delivers a highly reactive form that is activated both by the Lewis acidic aluminum center and the nearby lithium cation. Hence, the considerable rate‐increase for only two substrates ( p DMA‐BA and acetone) and the relatively small effect for the most activated substrate ( p NO 2 ‐BA) showcases the unique impact of MLC on the reaction kinetics. Usually, strongly activated substrates show high turnover frequencies with conventional catalysts (such as with Lewis acid or Lewis base catalysts). 1 ] − as the catalyst, such substrates ( p NO 2 ‐BA in our case) get effectively blocked by the MLC 1,2‐binding mode and allow the less activated substrates such as p DMA‐BA and acetone to outpace. In other words, the MLC‐dependent mode of substrate interaction allows to twist common selectivity trends and might enable a novel mode to steer regioselectivities in more complex substrates.

Conclusion A successful transfer of the d‐block MLC‐concept into the p ‐block would allow to couple the abundance of metals such as aluminum with the vast range of established d‐block MLC catalytic transformations. Understanding the mechanistic details of MLC with main group elements is vital for this transfer. The herein presented work provides critical steps in such a direction. The calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate offers exceptionally high rates in the capture and release of C=O containing substrates. These features promptly raise the question on the driving force, that facilitates rapid transformations by cleavage of a C−C and Al−O bond. In contrast to the aromatization/dearomatization process observed in transition metal complexes, [ 1 ] − operates by a reversed dearomatization/aromatization sequence. Thus, qualitatively, the regain of aromaticity in a pyrrole ring governs the behavior in the substrate bound state. The full reversibility paired with the substantial alteration of the substrates’ electronic structures upon binding provides an ideal starting point for catalytic applications. By now, it permits unique control over reaction kinetics if applied as a hydroboration catalyst. We believe that the hereby developed perspectives will serve exemplary for exciting progress and retrofit the fields of MLC and DCC with the beneficial earth abundance of aluminum.

10.1002_chem.201902131,"Abstract A new synthetic route toward the tetrazole core is described, which is based on a general fragmentation pattern that was found in a range of compounds featuring geminal diazido units. Through a simple two‐step procedure, the synthesis of structurally diverse target compounds containing a tetrazole, such as tetrazoloquinoxalinones, benzoylaryltetrazoles, tetrazolotriazinones, and tetrazoloazepinones, was easily accomplished, starting from broadly accessible substrates (i.e., oxindoles, diarylethanones, pyrazolones, and phenanthrols). The initial oxidative diazidation reaction with iodine and sodium azide under mild conditions is followed by the thermal fragmentation under microwave irradiation, leading to the tetrazole products. Noteworthy, an experimental solution is presented in which the potentially hazardous diazide intermediates are not isolated and the concentration of crude reaction mixtures containing diazides is not required to achieve the tetrazoles in good yields.","Introduction Tetrazoles, with a particularly high percentage of nitrogen atoms in a stable cyclic compound, are nitrogen‐containing heterocycles of overwhelming interest, and they were heavily researched since their first appearance in the scientific literature in 1885.

In this paper, we now disclose our full results on the synthesis of tetrazole heterocycles, starting from geminal diazides and using simple thermolysis conditions. As summarized in Figure A , B , C , and D are presented.

Results and Discussion We began our studies with the thermal conversion of the 3,3‐diazidooxindoles 8 , a class of diazide compounds that was recently demonstrated to be easily accessible. o ‐xylene resulted in the transformation of 3,3‐diazidoindolin‐2‐one ( 8 a ) into tetrazolo[1,5‐ a ]quinoxalin‐4(5 H )‐one ( 9 a ) in an excellent yield of 97 % without further optimization. After two hours at 140 °C, complete consumption of the starting material was observed and the product precipitated as a colorless solid, which was then isolated through simple filtration. We note that classical heating conditions provide nearly identical results, albeit with elongated reaction times. The structure of tetrazole 9 a was unequivocally evidenced by X‐ray crystallography: A suitable single crystal of 9 a was grown from DMSO and demonstrated that the carbonyl group was connected to the tetrazole carbon atom, whereas the aryl group was migrated onto the nitrogen atom. We were not able to detect even traces of the isomeric tetrazole 9 a ′, which shows that the diazide fragmentation proceeds with excellent regioselectivity. The thermal properties of 9 a were studied by differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; see Supporting Information). TGA curves show that decomposition of the tetrazole starts at 280 °C. Drop hammer experiments proved that 9 a is not sensitive to impact (>20 J). Synthesis and X‐ray crystal structure of tetrazolo[1,5‐ a ]quinoxalin‐4(5 H )‐one 9 a . We then turned our attention to the substrate scope and found that a good variety of oxindole derivatives were smoothly transformed into the corresponding tetrazoloquinoxalinones in good to excellent yields, employing the conditions detailed in Scheme a ]quinoxalin‐4(5 H )‐one ( 9 b ) and its trifluoromethyl derivative 9 c were isolated in 86 and 87 % yield, respectively. With the 6‐chloro substituent, the reaction furnished product 9 g in 90 % yield. Regarding the substituents at the 8‐position, bromo ( 9 f ), nitro ( 9 h ), methoxy ( 9 j ), and tert ‐butyldimethylsilyloxy ( 9 k ) substituents were successfully used and gave the products with yields ranging from 76 to 97 %. The structure of 9 f was supported by X‐ray crystallography, revealing the connectivity of the quinoxalinone core. As demonstrated by the formation of 9 d in 96 % and 9 e in 82 %, N ‐substituted diazidooxindoles were also transformed. Furthermore, the two structurally interesting pyrido derivatives 9 i and 9 l were obtained in high yields, by using diazidopyrrolopyridinone starting materials. We note that all products were easily isolated in pure form after cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature followed by filtration. Scope of the formation of tetrazolo[1,5‐ a ]quinoxalin‐4(5 H )‐ones 9 . The tricyclic scaffold of the product compounds 9 represents an interesting system, having potential applications in medicinal chemistry and crop protection. H )‐ones were converted into the desired tetrazoloquinoxalin‐4(5 H )‐ones through nucleophilic substitution with sodium azide H )‐ones under metal‐catalyzed and oxidative conditions was employed to construct this kind of tetrazoles. Despite the obvious disadvantages of the preceding approaches to tetrazoloquinoxalinones 9 , such as the use of toxic and explosive reagents or prefunctionalized starting compounds, we felt that practicing chemists may be somewhat reluctant to use our method because diazidooxindoles 8 appear to be potentially hazardous compounds. To increase the attraction of our oxindole‐based synthetic strategy, we decided to develop an experimental variant that provides the tetrazoloquinoxalinones 9 directly from the simplest oxindoles 10 . With the new protocol used for the examples in Table 8 . The other goal was to make sure that dilute reaction mixtures containing crude organic diazides were not concentrated, at any stage. To this end, the oxindoles 10 were converted under our standard diazidation conditions, by using sodium azide and iodine in aqueous DMSO at room temperature, as published before. o ‐xylene, thus removing azide and iodide ions with the aqueous phase. The organic layer containing the diazidooxindoles was then submitted to the thermolysis conditions. After the indicated heating time at 140 °C and subsequent cooling to room temperature, the desired tetrazoloquinoxalinones precipitated in pure form. This safety‐optimized protocol allowed for the tetrazoloquinoxalinone synthesis in good overall yields, in a pretty general way.

To our delight, the conversion of diazidodiarylethanones 11 a and 11 b furnished the corresponding benzoylaryltetrazoles 12 , under the straightforward thermolysis conditions, after a slightly elongated reaction time (Scheme Reaction of diazidodiarylethanones 11 to tetrazoles 12 . We also applied the safety‐optimized protocol to the benzoylaryltetrazole synthesis: The 1,2‐diarylethanones 13 were diazidated under standard conditions, and the work‐up procedure with o ‐xylene was utilized as described above. The subsequent thermal fragmentation was carried out by using an oil bath at 140 °C, and purification by column chromatography gave the tetrazole products. As summarized in Scheme 12 were obtained in moderate to good yields, ranging from 42 to 71 %. Methyl, methoxy, and chloro substituents were easily installed at the aromatic cores. The structure of tetrazole 12 a was verified by X‐ray crystallography; a suitable single crystal was grown from chloroform‐ d  1 . The benzoyl group was attached to the carbon atom of the tetrazole nucleus, whereas the phenyl group migrated onto the neighboring nitrogen.  Safety‐optimized formation of benzoylaryltetrazoles 12 . The method was further extended to the aromatic core of 9‐phenanthrol ( 14 ) (Scheme 15 in 77 % yield, and the aromaticity of the central ring was abolished. Under microwave irradiation at 140 °C, fragmentation of the diazido unit occurred, providing the 9 H ‐dibenzo[ d , f ]‐tetrazolo[1,5‐ a ]azepin‐9‐one ( 16 ) in 91 % yield. The safety‐optimized protocol gave azepinone 16 in a moderate yield of 48 %. We point out that our literature search did not reveal any previous reports on the synthesis and chemistry of dibenzotetrazoloazepinones similar to 16 . Diazidation of 9‐phenanthrol 14 and formation of 9 H ‐dibenzo[ d , f ]tetrazolo[1,5‐ a ]azepin‐9‐one 16 . Finally, we studied the fragmentation of diazides 17 derived from pyrazolones under thermolysis conditions (Scheme 17 by using our oxidative diazidation method 17 a – c were obtained in moderate yields, for example. Notably, a few previous studies by others were able to provide similar 4,4‐diazidopyrazolones starting from the corresponding dibromo pyrazolones and through substitution with azide anions. 17 a – c to thermolysis at 140 °C under microwave irradiation, tetrazolotriazinones 19 a – c were obtained in good yields between 62 and 71 %. The structure of 19 a was confirmed with X‐ray crystallography. Tetrazolo[1,5‐ d ][1,2,4]triazin‐8(7 H )‐ones 19 belong to a class of compounds that was barely synthesized prior to this work. 19 possesses a high degree of nitrogen atoms and, therefore, holds potential as energetic compounds. Preliminary impact sensitivity measurements with tetrazole 19 b by using drop hammer tests showed that the compound is relatively stable (>20 J). TGA‐DSC curves show that the decomposition of tetrazole 19 b starts at around 173 °C (see Supporting Information). Synthesis of tetrazolotriazinones 19 . Our results clearly demonstrate the ease of accessing various kinds of tetrazoles through the thermolysis of geminal diazides. As presented in Scheme A that undergoes direct cyclization to the tetrazole product. Mechanistic proposal for tetrazole formation.

Conclusions In conclusion, we have reported a new and general synthetic approach toward tetrazole heterocycles. Through a simple two‐step procedure consisting of oxidative diazidation and subsequent thermolysis, simple starting compounds were easily transformed into several barely known classes of tetrazoles, including tetrazoloquinoxalinones, benzoylaryltetrazoles, dibenzotetrazoloazepinones, and tetrazolotriazinones. We also addressed safety issues regarding the potentially hazardous character of diazido intermediates with the goal to render the method more attractive to practitioners and to trigger its use in all fields of chemistry. In upcoming studies, we will expand this thermolysis approach to other compounds bearing the geminal diazido motif, in order to complete our understanding of the key aspects of this thermal fragmentation and to grasp the full capability of transforming this still neglected compound class.

10.1002_chem.201903120,"Abstract Systematic variation of the 1,4‐dioxane (dx) concentration during the precipitation of sparingly soluble [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] from ethereal Grignard solutions of RMgBr has allowed the structural investigation of crystallized [R 2 Mg(dx) ] ( n n =1, 1.5, 2, and 3), which form during this dioxane method, depending on the bulkiness of R. The numbering of the complexes explored in this study is based on the number n of dioxane molecules per magnesium atom, followed by the substituent R; an apostrophe denotes coordination polymers. The following derivatives were studied by X‐ray crystal‐structure determination and NMR spectroscopy: n =1: [Me 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Me ) and [ n Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ ); n Pr n =1.5: [{ i Pr 2 Mg(dx)} 2 (μ‐dx)] ( 1.5‐ ), [{ i Pr o Tol 2 Mg(dx)} 2 (μ‐dx)] ( 1.5‐ ), and [(Me o Tol 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ] ∞ ( 1.5′‐C ); 2 SiMe 3 n =2: [ t Bu 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ( 2‐ ) and [ t Bu o Tol 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ( 2‐ ); o Tol n =3: [Ph 2 Mg(dx) 3 ] ( 3‐Ph ). In the structure types 1′ , 1.5 , and 2 , the magnesium atom exhibits the coordination number 4, whereas pentacoordinate metal atoms are observed in types 3 and 1.5′ . The structure type 2′ is realized for [(Ph‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐C ), [MgCl 2 Ph 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Cl ), and [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) with hexacoordinate metal atoms. The solubility of the dioxane adducts in common organic solvents strongly depends on the degree of aggregation with the solubility decreasing from molecular to strand to layer structures.","Introduction Grignard reagents, namely organylmagnesium halides, can be straightforwardly synthesized by the reduction of halohydrocarbons with magnesium turnings (direct synthesis). 2 , and MgX 2 ; a simplified picture is shown in Scheme Formation of the Grignard reagent (top) and Schlenk equilibrium (bottom) of organylmagnesium halides interconverting RMgX into homoleptic MgR 2 and MgX 2 (L is an electroneutral Lewis base such as an ether). Colored dashed lines symbolize deaggregation possibilities leading to the equilibria shown with arrows in the same color. There has been great interest in halide‐free di(hydrocarbyl)magnesium compounds for several decades. 6 I 2 from RMgI solutions 2 . However, an approved and reliable procedure for the removal of magnesium halides from Grignard solutions, discovered by Schlenk 90 years ago, was realized by the addition of 1,4‐dioxane (dx, the dioxane method), as depicted in Scheme Dioxane method to shift the Schlenk equilibrium of organylmagnesium halides toward soluble [R 2 Mg(dx) ] and insoluble [MgX n 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ by substitution of the Lewis base L (e.g., diethyl ether or thf) by 1,4‐dioxane (dx). Diverse observations led to refined procedures for the dioxane method. It proves to be very beneficial to allow the MgX 2 ‐containing precipitate to age overnight at room temperature. The solid is then less voluminous and more compact, which allows a less time‐consuming removal by filtration. During this time, initially trapped MgR 2 dissolves, which enhances the yield of diorganylmagnesium. During solvate formation, dioxane competes with the Lewis basic solvent L of the Grignard reaction, the donor strength of the ethers increasing in the order Et 2 O≪thf≤dx. Consequently, the precipitation of magnesium halides from diethyl ether solutions is nearly quantitative and application of a very small excess of 1,4‐dioxane is sufficient, whereas in THF solution even a large excess of dx still leads to incomplete removal of MgX 2 . Dioxane molecules can coordinate to metal cations through three different binding modes: The chair conformation enables η 1 ‐terminal as well as μ‐ O , O ′‐bridging coordination modes, whereas the boat conformation with an η 2 ‐ O , O ′‐chelating binding mode is as yet unknown in organomagnesium chemistry. The filtrate contains diorganylmagnesium complexes [R 2 Mg(dx) ], but the use of very bulky R groups can lead to soluble RMgX(dx) n compounds, showing that the Schlenk equilibrium is not always quantitatively shifted toward the homoleptic congeners. n Structural diversity of hitherto known 1,4‐dioxane adducts of diorganylmagnesium complexes authenticated by X‐ray crystal‐structure determinations. The compounds are labeled considering the number n of 1,4‐dioxane ligands, with an apostrophe symbolizing coordination polymers, followed by the hydrocarbyl group R. Thus, 1′‐Me characterizes [Me 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ . Besides mononuclear complexes of the type [R 2 Mg(η 1 ‐dx) 2 ] ( 2‐R with R=Mes, 2 B 10 H 10 , 9 H 7 (indenyl) 2 Mg(dx)} 2 (μ‐dx)] (type 1.5‐R with R=Bz 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ (type 1′‐R with R=Et, 2  t Bu, i Pr, 3 Si) 2 MeSi} 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] of type 2 , 2 SiMe 3 ) 3 (μ‐dx)(η 1 ‐dx)] ∞ , 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 } 2 (μ‐dx)] expand this class of dioxane adducts. 2 ] without co‐ligands can be stabilized with very bulky groups such as C(SiMe 3 ) 3 and 2,4,6‐ t Bu 3 C 6 H 2 (Mes*). To systematically investigate the coordination chemistry of dioxane adducts of organomagnesium complexes, we chose simple hydrocarbyl groups without additional heteroatoms. The di(hydrocarbyl)magnesium derivatives were studied in solution and in the crystalline state, depending on the dioxane concentration as well as the size and nature of the hydrocarbyl group R. Thus, we varied the following parameters:   The chain length of aliphatic carbanions (R=Me, Et, n Pr, and n Bu), The degree of substitution of aliphatic carbanions (R=Me, Et, i Pr, and t Bu), The steric demand of aromatic carbanions (R=Ph, o Tol, Mes, and Mes*), Slim di(alkynyl)magnesium–dioxane adducts (R=C≡C‐Ph, C≡C‐SiMe 3 ). This selection of organic ligands has allowed us to elucidate the influence of steric pressure and hybridization, because the organic groups R encompass sp 3 ‐ (alkyl), sp 2 ‐ (aryl), and sp‐hybridized (alkynyl) anionic carbon atoms. Furthermore, various molar ratios of MgR 2 /dx were employed during the crystallization procedures.

Results and Discussion  n ‐Alkylmagnesium–dioxane adducts We first studied the effect of the chain length of alkyl groups on the properties and molecular structures of [R 2 Mg(dx) ] after precipitation and removal of the magnesium halides. The simplest derivative is dimethylmagnesium. n 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Me ) depicted in Figure Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [Me 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Me , top). The ellipsoids represent a probability of 30 %. Hydrogen atoms are not shown for reasons of clarity. The strand structure is depicted at the bottom. Selected bond lengths [pm]: Mg1−C1 212.98(16), 208.88(11); bond angles [°]: C1‐Mg1‐C1A 135.19(9), O1‐Mg1‐O1A 95.04(7), O1‐Mg1‐C1 104.92(3), O1‐Mg1‐C1A 104.92(3). The crystal structure consists of parallel zigzag chains of MgMe 2 units bridged by dioxane ligands with chair conformations. The dx ligands are arranged in a face‐to‐face manner. This arrangement leads to a zigzag chain with a larger amplitude than observed for the coordination polymers of the type [R 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ with R=Et, Ph, Cy, and i Pr. The Mg⋅⋅⋅Mg distance of 889.14(3) pm between the first and third MgMe 2 moieties in 1′‐Me is significantly smaller than in other magnesium congeners of this type with values of approximately 1150–1240 pm. 2 units with dioxane ligands arranged back‐to‐back, this is the favored structure for larger R groups. Three possible arrangements of the 1,4‐dioxane bases in coordination polymers of the type [R 2 Mg(μ‐dx] ∞ . Top: face‐to‐face; middle: face‐to‐back; bottom: back‐to‐back. Complex 1′‐Me is only very sparingly soluble in diethyl ether, but readily dissolves in THF and is soluble in warm 1,4‐dioxane. From a pure dioxane solution, again strand‐like 1′‐Me crystallized and a complex containing more dioxane was not observed. The NMR spectra in [D 8 ]THF solution show the resonances for the magnesium‐bound methyl groups at δ ( 1 H)=−1.82 ppm and δ ( 13 C)=−16.5 ppm ( 1  J  C,H =105.6 Hz). In this solvent, the strand structure is deaggregated by the substitution of dx ligands by THF Lewis bases. The addition of 1,4‐dioxane to an ethereal solution of ethylmagnesium bromide and removal of the precipitated magnesium bromides yielded the known strand structure [Et 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Et ). 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ crystallized again from a solvent mixture of dioxane and diethyl ether (ratio of 5:1). The dioxane adduct of di( n ‐propyl)magnesium is soluble in diethyl ether and this complex crystallized again within several days from a 2.0 m solution of dioxane and diethyl ether (ratio of dx and Et 2 O of approx. 1:1) at −40 °C to yield colorless crystals of [ n Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ ), as shown in Figure n Pr Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [ n Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ , top). The ellipsoids represent a probability of 30 %. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for the sake of clarity. The strand structure is shown at the bottom. Selected bond lengths [pm]: Mg1−C1 215.20(12), Mg1−C4 215.57(12), Mg1−O1 212.05(9), Mg1−O2 209.31(8); bond angles [°]: C1‐Mg1‐C4 140.64(5), O1‐Mg1‐O2 96.55(4), O1‐Mg1‐C1 102.05(5), O1‐Mg1‐C4 100.01(4), O2‐Mg1‐C1 105.23(4), O2‐Mg1‐C4 104.13(4). n Pr The crystal structure of 1′‐ also consists of parallel zigzag chains of ( n Pr n Pr) 2 Mg moieties bridged by 1,4‐dioxane bases. However, the dioxane ligands show a face‐to‐back arrangement, as depicted in Scheme 1′‐Me , this orientation of the dx ligands leads to an elongation of the distance between the first and third magnesium atoms to 1080.96(8) pm. The nonbonding Mg1⋅⋅⋅Mg1A distance between neighboring magnesium atoms is 698.7(1) pm. Contrary to the shorter n ‐alkyl complexes, ( n Bu) 2 Mg did not crystallize from a 4.0 m ethereal solution at −40 °C. At −78 °C and upon layering with n ‐pentane, an amorphous solid with the composition [ n Bu 2 Mg(dx)] precipitated. The longer alkyl groups significantly enhances the solubility in ethereal solvents, thereby causing a deterioration in its crystallization behavior. Probably, the longer alkyl groups do not fit as well between the chains and smaller degrees of aggregation are realized. 1,4‐Dioxane adducts of (Me 3− H x x C) 2 Mg We next investigated the effect of the degree of substitution on the molecular structures of the dx adducts of (Me 3− H x C) x 2 Mg ( x= 3: Me; 2: Et; 1: i Pr; 0: t Bu). The simplest magnesium complex with secondary alkyl groups is di(isopropyl)magnesium, [ i Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ ), which has already been studied by Blasberg et al. i Pr i Pr 2 Mg(dx)} 2 (μ‐dx)] ( 1.5‐ ), is depicted in Figure i Pr Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [{ i Pr 2 Mg(dx)} 2 (μ‐dx)] ( 1.5‐ ).

Atoms B not shown. i Pr The structure is of type 1.5 and the Mg−C and Mg−O bond lengths are of the same order of magnitude as those observed for the strand structure. i Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ ). Thus, for the complexes with bulky isopropyl groups, two structures, i Pr 1′ and 1.5 , are observed depending on the dioxane concentration in the mother liquor, whereas for the n ‐propyl congeners the coordination polymer 1′ with exclusively bridging dioxane ligands seems to be favored. To further increase the bulkiness of the alkyl group, we studied the tert ‐butylmagnesium complex. After precipitation and removal of [MgCl 2 (dx) 2 ] from an ethereal solution of tert ‐butylmagnesium chloride we crystallized [ t Bu 2 Mg(η 1 ‐dx) 2 ] ( 2‐ ). The structure of this compound is depicted in Figure t Bu Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [ t Bu 2 Mg(η 1 ‐dx) 2 ] ( 2‐ ). The ellipsoids represent a probability of 30 %. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity reasons.

This structure type forms with sterically demanding groups and in the presence of a moderate excess of 1,4‐dioxane during crystallization. The Mg−C bond lengths of dialkylmagnesium increase in the order primary (213–215 pm) < secondary (214–216 pm) < tertiary alkyl groups (216–218 pm), whereas the C−Mg−C bond angles show no clear trend. The crystalline 2‐ partially loses ligated dioxane during the drying process in vacuo. We did not isolate this dioxane‐poor congener, but structures of t Bu tert ‐butylmagnesium complexes with dioxane ligands have already been observed in the heteroleptic [L 2 {Mg( t Bu)} 4 (μ‐dx) 2 ], in which L is a bidentate bridging ligand, and in the trinuclear compound [(thf)Mg( t Bu) 2 (μ‐dx)Mg( t Bu)LMg( t Bu)]. Structures of [Ar 2 Mg(dx) ] with increasing hindrance at the n ortho ‐substituted phenyl groups The coordination polymer [Ph 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Ph ) is insoluble in toluene. The addition of 1,4‐dioxane to this suspension led to a clear solution. Cooling of this solution again yielded the starting [Ph 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Ph ). Dissolution of these crystals in pure dioxane gave another complex that is highly soluble in dx. The clear crystals of this complex turned dull after isolation and removal of the mother liquor. The molecular structure of this dioxane adduct, [Ph 2 Mg(dx) 3 ] ( 3‐Ph ), is depicted in Figure Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [Ph 2 Mg(dx) 3 ] ( 3‐Ph ).

The τ parameter, which is an indicator of the geometry of pentacoordinate metal complexes, can be calculated according to the equation τ =( β − α )/60° (in which β is the largest and α the second largest bond angle at the metal center) with τ =1 for an ideal trigonal bipyramid and τ =0 for a square pyramid. 3‐Ph , a τ value of 0.66 was elucidated, which is much closer to a trigonal‐bipyramidal coordination sphere with O1 and O5 in apical positions (O1−Mg1−O5 164.68(4)°). Deviation from a linear arrangement is enforced by the steric repulsion between these dioxane ligands and the phenyl groups. The equatorial plane contains the ipso ‐carbon atoms C1 and C7 and the Lewis base O3 (angle sum=359.73(5)°). The higher coordination number of the magnesium atom in 3‐Ph leads to elongated Mg−C and Mg−O bonds (Mg−C 217.19(14) and 216.01(13) pm, Mg−O axial 224.51(11) and 228.99(11) pm, Mg−O equatorial 209.10(10) pm) in comparison with the strand structure [Ph 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Ph ; Mg−C 213.5(2) pm, Mg−O 208.1(2) and 206.1(2) pm) with tetracoordinate metal atoms. The type 2 diphenylmagnesium complex [Ph 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] is unknown even though Bickelhaupt and co‐workers were able to prepare the corresponding THF adduct [Ph 2 Mg(thf) 2 ].  Ortho substitution with methyl groups increases the steric requirements of the aryl groups and a coordination number of 5 could not be achieved. Consequently, addition of dioxane to an ethereal solution of o ‐tolylmagnesium bromide and removal of [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] allowed the crystallization and isolation of [( o Tol) 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ( 2‐ ) but not a strand‐like structure of type o Tol 1′ as found for diphenylmagnesium. The molecular structure of 2‐ is depicted in Figure o Tol Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [( o Tol) 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ( 2‐ ). The ellipsoids represent a probability of 30 %.

Compounds of the type [(R‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) ] ( n n =1.5 (SiMe 3 ) and 2 (Ph)) are nearly insoluble in diethyl ether, dioxane, and toluene, but soluble in THF. From such a solution, [(Ph‐C≡C) 2 Mg(thf) 4 ] was isolated with a distorted octahedral environment of the magnesium center. For solubility reasons we prepared an alkynyl complex by the deprotonation of trimethylsilylacetylene with [ n Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ ) in excess dioxane to yield a compound with the composition [(Me n Pr 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ]. This complex is soluble in THF but only very sparingly soluble in dioxane and insoluble in hydrocarbons, which is quite unique for a complex of type 1.5 . The 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectrum shows two characteristic resonances at δ =112.1 and 158.5 ppm for the ethynyl fragment. To grow single crystals of this complex we stored a mixture of [ n Bu 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ( 1‐ ) and trimethylsilylacetylene in 1,4‐dioxane at 5 °C. This procedure allowed the slow crystallization of [(Me n Bu 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ] ∞ ( 1.5′‐C ), but the crystal quality was very poor. Therefore, we could only elucidate a structural motif. The structure is depicted in Figure 2 SiMe 3 Structural motif of [(Me 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ] ∞ ( 1.5′‐C ). The atoms are shown with arbitrary radii and hydrogen atoms have been neglected for reasons of clarity. 2 SiMe 3 Despite poor crystal quality and a substandard data set, the structural motif was deduced unequivocally and revealed the solid‐state structure. The pentacoordinate magnesium atoms are embedded in trigonal‐bipyramidal environments with the alkynyl groups in apical positions. The 1,4‐dioxane ligands with chair conformations occupy equatorial positions and act as bridging ligands between magnesium atoms, leading to a layer structure. As a consequence of this packing, the magnesium atoms form a layer structure of regular six‐membered rings. The alkynyl ligands are bound above and below the layer and establish borders between two layers. Okuda and co‐workers 2 Mg(thf)(μ‐dx)] ∞ (all=allyl); the slim allyl groups here would have also allowed the formation of a layer structure, but two‐dimensional (2D) binding is prevented by the presence of the thf ligands instead of dx molecules. Therefore, a strand structure is observed in the crystalline state. A 2D network was found for the heterobimetallic compound [{M(all) 3 Mg(all) 2 } 2 (μ‐dx) 5 ] ∞ with M=Y and La. 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(thf) 4 ], all the dx ligands are substituted by thf ligands leading to the breakup of the coordination polymer to yield discrete molecular complexes with hexacoordinate magnesium atoms. The metalation of phenylacetylene with bis(dioxane)di( tert ‐butyl)magnesium ( 2‐ ) in diethyl ether yielded quantitatively [(Ph‐C≡C) t Bu 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐C ), which is nearly insoluble in 1,4‐dioxane. The NMR spectra reveal that two dioxane molecules are bound to the magnesium center. The crystal structure of [(Ph‐C≡C) 2 Ph 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐C ) verifies that the magnesium atoms are embedded in octahedral environments forming a 2D network. The structure is depicted in Figure 2 Ph Molecular structure (top) and cutout of the layer structure of [(Ph‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐C , middle). The ellipsoids represent a probability of 30 %. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for the sake of clarity. The stacking of the layers is depicted at the bottom. 2 Ph Finally, we also investigated the 1,4‐dioxane adducts of magnesium chloride and bromide, which precipitated during the addition of dioxane to solutions of Grignard reagents. Extremely sparingly soluble [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) was tempered in warm tetrahydrofuran leading to a single crystalline solid. This observation is in agreement with the expectation that THF and dx exhibit comparable basicity leading to very low concentrations of soluble [MgBr 2 (thf) 4 ], which has been characterized previously. 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Cl ) exhibited comparable crystallization properties. The molecular structure of the coordination polymer [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) with a layer structure is depicted in Figure 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Cl ) is presented in the Supporting Information. The magnesium centers in 2′‐Br are embedded in octahedral environments with trans ‐arranged halide ions. The environments of the magnesium centers are very similar to that in the molecular tetrahydrofuran adduct [MgBr 2 (thf) 4 ] with average Mg−O and Mg−Br bond lengths of 216 and 262.5 pm, respectively. 2 (thf) 2 ] ∞ , which has been crystallized from a mixture of dichloromethane and hexane, the bromine atoms occupy bridging positions leading to a coordination polymer with rather similar Mg−O and Mg−Br distances of 212.6 and 263.3 pm, respectively.

Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for the sake of clarity. The stacking of the layers is shown at the bottom. The Mg(dx) networks of the layer structures of [(Me 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ] ∞ ( 1.5′‐C ) and [MgBr 2 SiMe 3 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) are compared in Figure 1.5′‐C lead to a honeycomb structure, whereas the smaller bromine atoms in 2 SiMe 3 2′‐Br lead to a tessellated structure. The directing influence exerted by the steric demand of the groups R is evident in Figure Structural diversity of the coordination polymers [(Me 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ] ∞ ( 1.5′‐C , left) and [MgR 2 SiMe 3 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐C , 2 Ph 2′‐Cl , and 2′‐Br , right) with penta‐ and hexacoordinate metal centers, respectively. The circles at the knots of the network represent the magnesium atoms and the connecting lines symbolize the bridging 1,4‐dioxane ligands. Substitution of dx in [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ (2′‐Br) Due to the fact that [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) is nearly insoluble in common organic solvents, several attempts were undertaken to recrystallize this coordination polymer. Crystallization of 2′‐Br from a solvent mixture of DMF and dioxane led to the precipitation of [{(dmf) 6 Mg}Br 2 ] ( A ). The molecular structure contains a centrosymmetric cation with a hexacoordinate metal center and clearly separated bromide ions (Mg⋅⋅⋅Br 527.7(3) and 678.2(3) pm, see the Supporting Information). Traces of water also led to the precipitation of a few crystals of the more soluble [{ trans ‐(H 2 O) 2 Mg(dmf) 4 }Br 2 ] ∞ ( B , see the Supporting Information). In this latter centrosymmetric molecule, the magnesium atom is in an octahedral environment, coordinated to the oxygen donors of the dmf ligands (Mg−O 202.86(10) and 208.26(10) pm) and water (Mg−O 209.89(11) pm). The bromide ions are again separated from the cations (Mg⋅⋅⋅Br 480.8 and 493.8 pm), but are bound at the periphery through hydrogen bridges to the water ligands (Br⋅⋅⋅H 248.6 and 252.1 pm). This mode of coordination leads to the formation of a coordination polymer with a strand structure. Extraction of [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) with hot 1,2‐dimethoxyethane (dme) only allowed the isolation of the already known [ cis ‐Br 2 Mg(dme) 2 ] ( C ). 2 , namely [(diglyme)Mg(Br)(μ‐Br)] 2 ( D ) and [(diglyme)(thf)MgBr 2 ] ( E ) with distorted octahedrally coordinated metal centers.

 n ‐Alkylmagnesium–dioxane adducts We first studied the effect of the chain length of alkyl groups on the properties and molecular structures of [R 2 Mg(dx) ] after precipitation and removal of the magnesium halides. The simplest derivative is dimethylmagnesium. n 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Me ) depicted in Figure Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [Me 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Me , top). The ellipsoids represent a probability of 30 %. Hydrogen atoms are not shown for reasons of clarity. The strand structure is depicted at the bottom. Selected bond lengths [pm]: Mg1−C1 212.98(16), 208.88(11); bond angles [°]: C1‐Mg1‐C1A 135.19(9), O1‐Mg1‐O1A 95.04(7), O1‐Mg1‐C1 104.92(3), O1‐Mg1‐C1A 104.92(3). The crystal structure consists of parallel zigzag chains of MgMe 2 units bridged by dioxane ligands with chair conformations. The dx ligands are arranged in a face‐to‐face manner. This arrangement leads to a zigzag chain with a larger amplitude than observed for the coordination polymers of the type [R 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ with R=Et, Ph, Cy, and i Pr. The Mg⋅⋅⋅Mg distance of 889.14(3) pm between the first and third MgMe 2 moieties in 1′‐Me is significantly smaller than in other magnesium congeners of this type with values of approximately 1150–1240 pm. 2 units with dioxane ligands arranged back‐to‐back, this is the favored structure for larger R groups. Three possible arrangements of the 1,4‐dioxane bases in coordination polymers of the type [R 2 Mg(μ‐dx] ∞ . Top: face‐to‐face; middle: face‐to‐back; bottom: back‐to‐back. Complex 1′‐Me is only very sparingly soluble in diethyl ether, but readily dissolves in THF and is soluble in warm 1,4‐dioxane. From a pure dioxane solution, again strand‐like 1′‐Me crystallized and a complex containing more dioxane was not observed. The NMR spectra in [D 8 ]THF solution show the resonances for the magnesium‐bound methyl groups at δ ( 1 H)=−1.82 ppm and δ ( 13 C)=−16.5 ppm ( 1  J  C,H =105.6 Hz). In this solvent, the strand structure is deaggregated by the substitution of dx ligands by THF Lewis bases. The addition of 1,4‐dioxane to an ethereal solution of ethylmagnesium bromide and removal of the precipitated magnesium bromides yielded the known strand structure [Et 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Et ). 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ crystallized again from a solvent mixture of dioxane and diethyl ether (ratio of 5:1). The dioxane adduct of di( n ‐propyl)magnesium is soluble in diethyl ether and this complex crystallized again within several days from a 2.0 m solution of dioxane and diethyl ether (ratio of dx and Et 2 O of approx. 1:1) at −40 °C to yield colorless crystals of [ n Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ ), as shown in Figure n Pr Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [ n Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ , top). The ellipsoids represent a probability of 30 %. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for the sake of clarity. The strand structure is shown at the bottom. Selected bond lengths [pm]: Mg1−C1 215.20(12), Mg1−C4 215.57(12), Mg1−O1 212.05(9), Mg1−O2 209.31(8); bond angles [°]: C1‐Mg1‐C4 140.64(5), O1‐Mg1‐O2 96.55(4), O1‐Mg1‐C1 102.05(5), O1‐Mg1‐C4 100.01(4), O2‐Mg1‐C1 105.23(4), O2‐Mg1‐C4 104.13(4). n Pr The crystal structure of 1′‐ also consists of parallel zigzag chains of ( n Pr n Pr) 2 Mg moieties bridged by 1,4‐dioxane bases. However, the dioxane ligands show a face‐to‐back arrangement, as depicted in Scheme 1′‐Me , this orientation of the dx ligands leads to an elongation of the distance between the first and third magnesium atoms to 1080.96(8) pm. The nonbonding Mg1⋅⋅⋅Mg1A distance between neighboring magnesium atoms is 698.7(1) pm. Contrary to the shorter n ‐alkyl complexes, ( n Bu) 2 Mg did not crystallize from a 4.0 m ethereal solution at −40 °C. At −78 °C and upon layering with n ‐pentane, an amorphous solid with the composition [ n Bu 2 Mg(dx)] precipitated. The longer alkyl groups significantly enhances the solubility in ethereal solvents, thereby causing a deterioration in its crystallization behavior. Probably, the longer alkyl groups do not fit as well between the chains and smaller degrees of aggregation are realized.

1,4‐Dioxane adducts of (Me 3− H x x C) 2 Mg We next investigated the effect of the degree of substitution on the molecular structures of the dx adducts of (Me 3− H x C) x 2 Mg ( x= 3: Me; 2: Et; 1: i Pr; 0: t Bu). The simplest magnesium complex with secondary alkyl groups is di(isopropyl)magnesium, [ i Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ ), which has already been studied by Blasberg et al. i Pr i Pr 2 Mg(dx)} 2 (μ‐dx)] ( 1.5‐ ), is depicted in Figure i Pr Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [{ i Pr 2 Mg(dx)} 2 (μ‐dx)] ( 1.5‐ ).

Atoms B not shown. i Pr The structure is of type 1.5 and the Mg−C and Mg−O bond lengths are of the same order of magnitude as those observed for the strand structure. i Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ ). Thus, for the complexes with bulky isopropyl groups, two structures, i Pr 1′ and 1.5 , are observed depending on the dioxane concentration in the mother liquor, whereas for the n ‐propyl congeners the coordination polymer 1′ with exclusively bridging dioxane ligands seems to be favored. To further increase the bulkiness of the alkyl group, we studied the tert ‐butylmagnesium complex. After precipitation and removal of [MgCl 2 (dx) 2 ] from an ethereal solution of tert ‐butylmagnesium chloride we crystallized [ t Bu 2 Mg(η 1 ‐dx) 2 ] ( 2‐ ). The structure of this compound is depicted in Figure t Bu Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [ t Bu 2 Mg(η 1 ‐dx) 2 ] ( 2‐ ). The ellipsoids represent a probability of 30 %.

This structure type forms with sterically demanding groups and in the presence of a moderate excess of 1,4‐dioxane during crystallization. The Mg−C bond lengths of dialkylmagnesium increase in the order primary (213–215 pm) < secondary (214–216 pm) < tertiary alkyl groups (216–218 pm), whereas the C−Mg−C bond angles show no clear trend. The crystalline 2‐ partially loses ligated dioxane during the drying process in vacuo. We did not isolate this dioxane‐poor congener, but structures of t Bu tert ‐butylmagnesium complexes with dioxane ligands have already been observed in the heteroleptic [L 2 {Mg( t Bu)} 4 (μ‐dx) 2 ], in which L is a bidentate bridging ligand, and in the trinuclear compound [(thf)Mg( t Bu) 2 (μ‐dx)Mg( t Bu)LMg( t Bu)].

Structures of [Ar 2 Mg(dx) ] with increasing hindrance at the n ortho ‐substituted phenyl groups The coordination polymer [Ph 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Ph ) is insoluble in toluene. The addition of 1,4‐dioxane to this suspension led to a clear solution. Cooling of this solution again yielded the starting [Ph 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Ph ). Dissolution of these crystals in pure dioxane gave another complex that is highly soluble in dx. The clear crystals of this complex turned dull after isolation and removal of the mother liquor. The molecular structure of this dioxane adduct, [Ph 2 Mg(dx) 3 ] ( 3‐Ph ), is depicted in Figure Molecular structure and numbering scheme of [Ph 2 Mg(dx) 3 ] ( 3‐Ph ).

The τ parameter, which is an indicator of the geometry of pentacoordinate metal complexes, can be calculated according to the equation τ =( β − α )/60° (in which β is the largest and α the second largest bond angle at the metal center) with τ =1 for an ideal trigonal bipyramid and τ =0 for a square pyramid. 3‐Ph , a τ value of 0.66 was elucidated, which is much closer to a trigonal‐bipyramidal coordination sphere with O1 and O5 in apical positions (O1−Mg1−O5 164.68(4)°). Deviation from a linear arrangement is enforced by the steric repulsion between these dioxane ligands and the phenyl groups. The equatorial plane contains the ipso ‐carbon atoms C1 and C7 and the Lewis base O3 (angle sum=359.73(5)°). The higher coordination number of the magnesium atom in 3‐Ph leads to elongated Mg−C and Mg−O bonds (Mg−C 217.19(14) and 216.01(13) pm, Mg−O axial 224.51(11) and 228.99(11) pm, Mg−O equatorial 209.10(10) pm) in comparison with the strand structure [Ph 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐Ph ; Mg−C 213.5(2) pm, Mg−O 208.1(2) and 206.1(2) pm) with tetracoordinate metal atoms. The type 2 diphenylmagnesium complex [Ph 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] is unknown even though Bickelhaupt and co‐workers were able to prepare the corresponding THF adduct [Ph 2 Mg(thf) 2 ].  Ortho substitution with methyl groups increases the steric requirements of the aryl groups and a coordination number of 5 could not be achieved. Consequently, addition of dioxane to an ethereal solution of o ‐tolylmagnesium bromide and removal of [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] allowed the crystallization and isolation of [( o Tol) 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ( 2‐ ) but not a strand‐like structure of type o Tol 1′ as found for diphenylmagnesium.

1,4‐Dioxane adducts of coordination polymers with layer structure After the investigation of di(hydrocarbyl)magnesium complexes with sp 3 ‐ (alkyl) and sp 2 ‐hybridized (aryl) carbon atoms, we also studied congeners with an sp‐hybridized carbon atom. Compounds of the type [(R‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) ] ( n n =1.5 (SiMe 3 ) and 2 (Ph)) are nearly insoluble in diethyl ether, dioxane, and toluene, but soluble in THF. From such a solution, [(Ph‐C≡C) 2 Mg(thf) 4 ] was isolated with a distorted octahedral environment of the magnesium center. For solubility reasons we prepared an alkynyl complex by the deprotonation of trimethylsilylacetylene with [ n Pr 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ ( 1′‐ ) in excess dioxane to yield a compound with the composition [(Me n Pr 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ]. This complex is soluble in THF but only very sparingly soluble in dioxane and insoluble in hydrocarbons, which is quite unique for a complex of type 1.5 . The 13 C{ 1 H} NMR spectrum shows two characteristic resonances at δ =112.1 and 158.5 ppm for the ethynyl fragment. To grow single crystals of this complex we stored a mixture of [ n Bu 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ( 1‐ ) and trimethylsilylacetylene in 1,4‐dioxane at 5 °C. This procedure allowed the slow crystallization of [(Me n Bu 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ] ∞ ( 1.5′‐C ), but the crystal quality was very poor. Therefore, we could only elucidate a structural motif. The structure is depicted in Figure 2 SiMe 3 Structural motif of [(Me 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ] ∞ ( 1.5′‐C ). The atoms are shown with arbitrary radii and hydrogen atoms have been neglected for reasons of clarity. 2 SiMe 3 Despite poor crystal quality and a substandard data set, the structural motif was deduced unequivocally and revealed the solid‐state structure. The pentacoordinate magnesium atoms are embedded in trigonal‐bipyramidal environments with the alkynyl groups in apical positions. The 1,4‐dioxane ligands with chair conformations occupy equatorial positions and act as bridging ligands between magnesium atoms, leading to a layer structure. As a consequence of this packing, the magnesium atoms form a layer structure of regular six‐membered rings. The alkynyl ligands are bound above and below the layer and establish borders between two layers. Okuda and co‐workers 2 Mg(thf)(μ‐dx)] ∞ (all=allyl); the slim allyl groups here would have also allowed the formation of a layer structure, but two‐dimensional (2D) binding is prevented by the presence of the thf ligands instead of dx molecules. Therefore, a strand structure is observed in the crystalline state. A 2D network was found for the heterobimetallic compound [{M(all) 3 Mg(all) 2 } 2 (μ‐dx) 5 ] ∞ with M=Y and La. 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(thf) 4 ], all the dx ligands are substituted by thf ligands leading to the breakup of the coordination polymer to yield discrete molecular complexes with hexacoordinate magnesium atoms. The metalation of phenylacetylene with bis(dioxane)di( tert ‐butyl)magnesium ( 2‐ ) in diethyl ether yielded quantitatively [(Ph‐C≡C) t Bu 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐C ), which is nearly insoluble in 1,4‐dioxane. The NMR spectra reveal that two dioxane molecules are bound to the magnesium center. The crystal structure of [(Ph‐C≡C) 2 Ph 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐C ) verifies that the magnesium atoms are embedded in octahedral environments forming a 2D network. The structure is depicted in Figure 2 Ph Molecular structure (top) and cutout of the layer structure of [(Ph‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐C , middle). The ellipsoids represent a probability of 30 %. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for the sake of clarity. The stacking of the layers is depicted at the bottom. 2 Ph Finally, we also investigated the 1,4‐dioxane adducts of magnesium chloride and bromide, which precipitated during the addition of dioxane to solutions of Grignard reagents. Extremely sparingly soluble [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) was tempered in warm tetrahydrofuran leading to a single crystalline solid. This observation is in agreement with the expectation that THF and dx exhibit comparable basicity leading to very low concentrations of soluble [MgBr 2 (thf) 4 ], which has been characterized previously. 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Cl ) exhibited comparable crystallization properties. The molecular structure of the coordination polymer [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) with a layer structure is depicted in Figure 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Cl ) is presented in the Supporting Information. The magnesium centers in 2′‐Br are embedded in octahedral environments with trans ‐arranged halide ions. The environments of the magnesium centers are very similar to that in the molecular tetrahydrofuran adduct [MgBr 2 (thf) 4 ] with average Mg−O and Mg−Br bond lengths of 216 and 262.5 pm, respectively. 2 (thf) 2 ] ∞ , which has been crystallized from a mixture of dichloromethane and hexane, the bromine atoms occupy bridging positions leading to a coordination polymer with rather similar Mg−O and Mg−Br distances of 212.6 and 263.3 pm, respectively.

Hydrogen atoms have been omitted for the sake of clarity. The stacking of the layers is shown at the bottom. The Mg(dx) networks of the layer structures of [(Me 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ] ∞ ( 1.5′‐C ) and [MgBr 2 SiMe 3 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) are compared in Figure 1.5′‐C lead to a honeycomb structure, whereas the smaller bromine atoms in 2 SiMe 3 2′‐Br lead to a tessellated structure. The directing influence exerted by the steric demand of the groups R is evident in Figure Structural diversity of the coordination polymers [(Me 3 Si‐C≡C) 2 Mg(dx) 1.5 ] ∞ ( 1.5′‐C , left) and [MgR 2 SiMe 3 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐C , 2 Ph 2′‐Cl , and 2′‐Br , right) with penta‐ and hexacoordinate metal centers, respectively. The circles at the knots of the network represent the magnesium atoms and the connecting lines symbolize the bridging 1,4‐dioxane ligands.

Substitution of dx in [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ (2′‐Br) Due to the fact that [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) is nearly insoluble in common organic solvents, several attempts were undertaken to recrystallize this coordination polymer. Crystallization of 2′‐Br from a solvent mixture of DMF and dioxane led to the precipitation of [{(dmf) 6 Mg}Br 2 ] ( A ). The molecular structure contains a centrosymmetric cation with a hexacoordinate metal center and clearly separated bromide ions (Mg⋅⋅⋅Br 527.7(3) and 678.2(3) pm, see the Supporting Information). Traces of water also led to the precipitation of a few crystals of the more soluble [{ trans ‐(H 2 O) 2 Mg(dmf) 4 }Br 2 ] ∞ ( B , see the Supporting Information). In this latter centrosymmetric molecule, the magnesium atom is in an octahedral environment, coordinated to the oxygen donors of the dmf ligands (Mg−O 202.86(10) and 208.26(10) pm) and water (Mg−O 209.89(11) pm). The bromide ions are again separated from the cations (Mg⋅⋅⋅Br 480.8 and 493.8 pm), but are bound at the periphery through hydrogen bridges to the water ligands (Br⋅⋅⋅H 248.6 and 252.1 pm). This mode of coordination leads to the formation of a coordination polymer with a strand structure. Extraction of [MgBr 2 (dx) 2 ] ∞ ( 2′‐Br ) with hot 1,2‐dimethoxyethane (dme) only allowed the isolation of the already known [ cis ‐Br 2 Mg(dme) 2 ] ( C ). 2 , namely [(diglyme)Mg(Br)(μ‐Br)] 2 ( D ) and [(diglyme)(thf)MgBr 2 ] ( E ) with distorted octahedrally coordinated metal centers.

Conclusions In this work we have systematically studied the synthesis of di(hydrocarbyl)magnesium complexes from ethereal solutions of Grignard reagents by the addition of 1,4‐dioxane. With very few exceptions, in which the Schlenk equilibrium lies completely on the side of heteroleptic RMgX complexes (such as [(Me 3 Si) 2 C{MgBr(dx) 2 } 2 ]), 2 M compounds. The type of crystalline [R 2 Mg(dx) ] adduct depends on the molar ratio of R n 2 Mg/dx in solution and on the hydrocarbyl group R, which influences the solubility and steric requirements. The structure types of the isolated crystalline derivatives are summarized in Table Structure types of crystalline [R 2 Mg(dx) ] with coordination numbers of the Mg n II atoms (C.N.(Mg)) of 4 (blue), 5 (red), and 6 (green) depending on the alkyl and aryl substituents R.     Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA High dioxane concentrations and bulkier organic groups promote the formation of highly soluble mononuclear compounds of structure types 3 (R=Ph) and 2 (R= t Bu, o Tol, and Mes i Pr, Bz, o Tol) dinuclear complexes of type 1.5 are accessible. This structure type can aggregate to form coordination polymers of type 1′ if the organic groups exhibit a medium‐to‐small size and if the concentration of 1,4‐dioxane during crystallization is rather low. For selected medium‐sized derivatives (R= i Pr, Ph, and o Tol) it was possible to isolate two different structures in the solid state. R 2 Mg congeners with extremely bulky groups (R=C(SiMe 3 ) 3 and Mes*) 1 with a three‐coordinate metal center is as yet unknown. The exchange equilibria with 1,4‐dioxane, which depend on complex concentration, MgR 2 /dioxane ratio, and the nature of the group R, are depicted in Scheme 2 Mg without co‐ligands can be stabilized with very bulky groups R or isolated after removal of dioxane in vacuo. The latter procedure even allowed the isolation of dimethylmagnesium as a coordination polymer with tetracoordinate magnesium atoms. Structural diversity of the hitherto known 1,4‐dioxane adducts of diorganylmagnesium complexes authenticated by X‐ray crystal‐structure determinations (complexes with tetracoordinate Mg are shown in blue, with pentacoordinate Mg in red, and with hexacoordinate Mg in green). The left column shows molecular complexes and solvation/desolvation reactions, the right column contains the coordination polymers arising from aggregation and deaggregation equilibria. The aggregation of mononuclear [R 2 Mg(dx) 2 ] would lead to the formation of a coordination polymer with hexacoordinate magnesium atoms. thf adducts with the composition [R 2 Mg(thf) 4 ] are known that require very slim ligands to allow an octahedral environment. The substitution of two thf ligands by a bridging dioxane molecule enables the formation of coordination polymers with hexacoordinate magnesium centers. The solubility of the magnesium complexes is strongly related to their aggregation chemistry. Molecular complexes of the types 1.5‐R , 2‐R , and 3‐R are highly soluble in ethereal solvents. The formation of strand structures reduces the solubility and compounds of type 1′‐R are sparingly soluble. Complexes of the types 1.5′‐R and 2′‐R form layer structures and are insoluble in common organic solvents. The degree of aggregation is influenced by the size and steric requirements of R, with small R ligands leading to higher coordination numbers of magnesium and higher degrees of aggregation.

Experimental Section General All manipulations were carried out under anaerobic conditions in an argon atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. The solvents were dried according to common procedures and distilled in an argon atmosphere; deuterated solvents were dried over sodium, degassed, and saturated with argon. The yields given are not optimized. The magnesium contents of the compounds were determined by complexometric titrations with Eriochrom Black T. n H 2 SO 4 against phenolphthalein. 1 H, 13 C{ 1 H}, and 29 Si{ 1 H} NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AC 400 spectrometer at given temperatures. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm, δ scale) relative to the residual signal of the solvent. 8 ]THF/dx exchange reactions in solution, only resonances of noncoordinated dioxane were detected in the NMR spectra. Trimethylsilylacetylene (98 %) and tert ‐butyl chloride (95–98 %) were supplied by ABCR GmbH, 1.0 m phenylmagnesium bromide solution in THF by Merck, o ‐bromotoluene (98 %) by Lancaster, isopropyl chloride by Fluka, n ‐butyl chloride by Riedel de Haën, n ‐propyl bromide by Acros, and 3.0 m methylmagnesium chloride solution in THF by Sigma–Aldrich. Synthesis and characterization  Synthesis of [(CH ( 3 ) 2 Mg(μ‐dx)] ∞ 1′‐Me ): A solution of commercial 3.0 m methylmagnesium chloride in THF (17 mL, 51 mmol) was diluted with THF (50 mL). The slow addition of 1,4‐dioxane (18 mL, 204 mmol) led to the precipitation of [MgCl 2 (dx) 2 ]. The reaction mixture was stored overnight at room temperature and then filtered through a frit covered with diatomaceous earth. A yield of 87 % was determined by titration of an aliquot of the filtrate with 0.1 n HCl. All volatiles were removed in vacuo and the residue evacuated until dryness. The residue was dissolved in dioxane (30 mL) and this suspension was heated at reflux for 10 min. Then, the hot solution was filtered through a Schlenk frit covered with diatomaceous earth. During cooling of the filtrate colorless crystals precipitated. These crystals were collected on a frit, washed with diethyl ether, and dried in vacuo. Yield: 1.3 g of 1′‐Me (35.8 % relative to CH 3 MgCl). During hydrolysis of this compound with ice/water, inflammation occurred. Therefore, a specific amount of this compound was dissolved in THF and this solution was carefully hydrolyzed to quantitatively determine the metal content.

During this procedure a colorless solid precipitated. The suspension was stored overnight at room temperature Then, the precipitate was removed by means of a Schlenk frit covered with diatomaceous earth and washed with diethyl ether. Acidimetric titration of an aliquot gave a yield of 33 %. The filtrate was concentrated till crystallization started and then stored in a refrigerator. This suspension was mixed with heptane (20 mL) and the precipitate collected on a frit and washed with heptane. The solid was briefly dried in vacuo because it lost ligated dioxane when exposed to a vacuum.

Single crystals were grown from a solvent mixture of diethyl ether and 1,4‐dioxane.  Synthesis of [( ( o Tol) 2 Mg(η 1 ‐dx) 2 ] 2‐ ): Magnesium turnings (3.0 g, 123 mmol) were suspended in diethyl ether (100 mL). Thereafter, o Tol o ‐tolyl bromide (17.09 g, 99 mmol) was slowly added to the mixture in portions of 2 mL. The reaction was initiated by the addition of some drops of 1,2‐dibromoethane.

Synthesis of [Ph ( 2 Mg(η 1 ‐dx) 3 ] 3‐Ph ): A commercially available 1.0 m PhMgBr solution in THF (50 mL, 50 mmol) and dioxane (50 mL) were combined and the mixture heated at reflux. During this procedure a colorless solid precipitated, which was removed by means of a Schlenk frit. All volatiles of the filtrate were removed in vacuo. The dry residue was dissolved in boiling dioxane (50 mL) and filtered through a Schlenk frit covered with diatomaceous earth.

Crystallography  Crystallization of [MgCl ] 2 (μ‐dx) 2 ( ∞ 2′‐Cl ): A 3.0 m solution of methylmagnesium chloride (3.0 mL, 9.0 mmol) in THF was diluted with THF (25 mL). 1,4‐Dioxane (2 mL, 22.7 mmol) was added to this solution. The clear solution was then heated at 65 °C in a 270 mL Schlenk tube to yield a white amorphous precipitate after a few minutes. After 1 week at this temperature, the precipitate transformed into colorless crystals of 2′‐Cl of different size.  Crystallization of [MgBr : A 0.9 2 (μ‐dx) 2 ] ∞ (2′‐Br) m solution of n ‐propylmagnesium bromide (3.0 mL, 2.7 mmol) in THF was diluted with THF (25 mL). Then, 1,4‐dioxane (0.9 mL, 10.2 mmol) was added. The clear solution was heated at 65 °C. During this procedure a colorless precipitate of 2′‐Br slowly formed. This suspension was tempered for 1 week at this temperature. During this time, the precipitate aged and turned into a crystalline solid with crystals of different size.

10.1002_chem.202001668,"Abstract We have added the {Re IV X 5 } − (X=Br, Cl) synthon to a pocket‐based ligand to provide supramolecular design using halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interactions within an Fe III system that has the potential to undergo spin crossover (SCO). By removing the solvent from the crystal lattice, we “switch on” halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interactions between neighboring molecules, providing a supramolecular cooperative pathway for SCO. Furthermore, changes to the halogen‐based interaction allow us to modify the temperature and nature of the SCO event.","Introduction Supramolecular chemistry is a rapidly expanding area of research, 4 –d 7 transition metal complexes can be accessed in response to external stimuli such as light, temperature, or pressure. In an attempt to produce a bimetallic 3d–5d molecule using a {ReX 5 } − synthon and a Schiff‐base contacting ligand with flexible binding pockets, similar to those previously used by our group III ‐5d systems. In practice we found that the transition metal preferentially occupies pocket 2, giving a mer ‐coordinated system with the general formula [Re IV   X 5 (μ‐ pch)Fe( R ‐Im) R’ 3 ] where H 2  pch has the formula ( R E )‐ N ’‐(2‐hydroxy‐3‐ ‐benzylidene)pyrazine‐2‐carbohydrazide, and R ‐Im has the formula 1‐ R’ ‐imidazole (Figure R’ Synthetic route for the preparation of ligands ( 9 )–( 11 ), [Re  X 5 ( pch)] R − (containing the a {ReX 5 } − synthon), and the complexes ( 1 )–( 4 ). The molecular structure in the desolvated compound ( 1 )d_100. Whilst the use of the {ReX 5 } − synthon has been seldom reported III compounds ( 5 )‐( 8 ) (see ESI), showed that the SCO properties of the Fe III center could be readily modified. Crystal structures are labelled with the general name “( Compound )w/d_TEMP”, where w or d denotes “wet” (solvated) or “dry” (desolvated) crystals, and TEMP is the temperature of the structural determination.

Results and Discussion Single crystal X‐ray analysis of complex ( 1 )w_100 shows that the complex crystallizes in the space group C 2/ c with Z =8. Complex ( 1 ) was chosen as a representative of the series with structural details of complexes ( 1 )–( 4 ) including halogen bond parameters in the ESI. The asymmetric unit contains a [Re  Br 5 (μ‐ pch)Fe( Me O ‐Im) Me 3 ] complex with the {Re IV Br 5 } synthon bound to a nitrogen atom of the pyrazine ring of the deprotonated MeO pch ligand. The central Fe III ion is coordinated to the ligand through an azine nitrogen (N1), a carbonyl oxygen (O3), and a hydroxy oxygen (O1), whilst three additional Me‐Im co‐ligands complete the coordination sphere through nitrogen atoms N5, N9, and N7. In addition to this there were two interstitial MeCN molecules within the lattice connected through nonclassical hydrogen bonds. The shortest intermolecular Br⋅⋅⋅Br distance was 4.663 Å and is therefore too long to be considered a halogen bond, and is unlikely to contribute to information exchange. 4 O 2 coordination sphere of the Fe III ion is often observed in SCO active compounds, 1 )w_280. Fe III −N bond lengths are characteristic of the spin state (LS≈1.95 Å and HS≈2.15 Å) 1 ) using a SQUID magnetometer revealed an SCO active system with an incomplete transition occurring between 220 K and 90 K, from fully HS to only 22 % of molecules in the HS electronic configuration with T 1/2 =155 K (Figure 1 )d_100 crystallized in the same space group, C 2/ c , with the same neutral metal complex in the asymmetric unit. However, the average Fe−N bond length (1.982 Å) indicated the complex was now at least partially in the LS state; it was also observed that the sample had desolvated (between measurements) with loss of the interstitial MeCN molecules (confirmed by elemental analysis) whilst retaining crystallinity. Crystallographic data were also collected at 140, 180, 230 and 280 K and by plotting the adjusted change in unit cell volume (see ESI for details) against the temperature the SCO event clearly correlates with the changes in the crystal structure (Figure  χT plot with overlaid adjusted unit cell volume (see ESI) for complex ( 1 ) showing the close correspondence of the values. Magnetic data collected under an applied DC field of 0.1 T. A more detailed investigation revealed that, by removing the lattice solvent and therefore the hydrogen bonding, halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interactions become the dominant supramolecular effect (Figure XB =1.217), however the loss of the solvent leads to reorientation of molecules in the crystal resulting in a significant shortening of the Br⋅⋅⋅Br distances, “switching on” a type I halogen bond (Br2⋅⋅⋅Br2’=3.733 Å, ∠Re‐Br⋅⋅⋅Br=176°, R XB =1.009). Packing rearrangement of ( 1 ) before (left) and after (right) loss of solvent molecules, both crystal structures measured at 100 K. Complexes ( 2 )–( 4 ) were then synthesized to characterize the importance of these halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interactions. The modifications are summarized in Table 2 ). Complex ( 2 )w_100 also crystallized in the space group C 2/ c with the neutral metal complex now [Re  Cl 5 (μ‐ pch)Fe( Me O ‐Im) Me 3 ] together with two MeCN molecules in the asymmetric unit. Analysis of the Fe−N bond lengths (average: 2.111 Å) shows the iron(III) center to be in the HS state at 100 K. In this solvated sample there is again no appreciable halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interaction, with the shortest Cl⋅⋅⋅Cl distance at 4.539 Å. Despite the apparent HS structure, magnetic investigation revealed that at 100 K the Fe III is mostly LS (74 % LS) (Figure 1 ) with the halogen bond “switching on” upon loss of solvent. Since this sample lost crystal quality during desolvation, the exact nature of the halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interaction could not be clearly defined. Previous work has ordered the strength of halogen bonds as F < Cl <Br < I. 1 ). Both events start at 230 K from a χT value of ≈5.8 cm 3 mol −1 K, however the T 1/2 value is 33 K lower (T 1/2 =124 K) for ( 2 ) consistent with the gradual nature of the crossover which occurs over a wider temperature range (130 K and 170 K for ( 1 ) and ( 2 ), respectively). The formula of the reported compounds ( 1 )–( 4 ) colored for clarity.

Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA  χT plots from the iron containing complexes ( 1 )—( 4 ) Data collected under an applied DC field of 0.1 T. Complex ( 3 ) was produced by changing the non‐coordinated MeO group on the primary‐ligand for the sterically larger EtO group. ( 3 )w_180 crystallized with a similar unit cell and packing, but in P 2 1 / n due to loss of C ‐centering. The asymmetric unit thus contains two [Re  Br 5 (μ‐ pch)Fe( Et O ‐Im) Me 3 ] complexes and a single molecule of MeCN. Both crystallographically independent complexes appear to be HS at 180 K with the average Fe‐N lengths of 2.116 Å and 2.101 Å for Fe1 and Fe2, respectively. In the complex containing Fe2 there is evidence of a weak type II halogen bond (Br7⋅⋅⋅Br10’ = 4.099 Å, ∠Re‐Br⋅⋅⋅Br = 131 & 119°, R XB = 1.108), which is missing for the molecule containing Fe1, thus only half the molecules in the crystal lattice can utilize a halogen bond mediated process. Upon complete solvent loss, sample ( 3 )d_180 undergoes a transformation to a structure with only one [Re  Br 5 (μ‐ pch)Fe( Et O ‐Im) Me 3 ] molecule in the asymmetric unit. In this case the halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interaction is stronger than previously observed (Br5⋅⋅⋅Br5’=3.888 Å, ∠Re‐Br⋅⋅⋅Br=121°, R XB =1.051) involving all molecules in the crystal. SCO events are highly sensitive and this slight change in peripheral substituent from MeO to EtO is enough to modify the SCO properties. 1/2 =98 K (Figure 1/2 highlights the suitability of this system to tune the SCO event towards a desired temperature. Finally, complex ( 4 ) which replaces the methyl group on the imidazole‐based secondary ligand, , with a larger ethyl group crystallizes without interstitial solvent, ( R’ 4 )d_180. In the case of ( 3 ) only one additional CH 2 unit was added to the molecule in a position placing it at a maximum distance from the {ReX 5 } − synthon. However, in complex ( 4 ) a total of three additional CH 2 units were introduced pushing the molecules further apart. In addition, a methyl group on one imidazole points directly into the {ReX 5 } − synthon (Figure XB =1.204). This results in a desolvated complex lacking halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interactions and therefore without the desired SCO behavior (Figure Representation of ( 4 )d_180 (left) and ( 1 )d_100 (right) shown in ball and stick with the “{ReX 5 }” and “imidazole group” in space filling mode demonstrating the steric hindrance induced by the ethyl group. R’ The results for the desolvated complex ( 4 ) rule out the possibility that removing solvent alone is enough to induce SCO properties and provide further evidence that in these systems a halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interaction is required. This highlights the key role of halogen bond mediated information exchange and demonstrates the potential for halogen bonding within SCO research. As a classic halogen bond is defined as an attractive dipolar interaction between nucleophilic and electrophilic halogen centers, the symmetrical ReBr 5 ⋅⋅⋅ReBr 5 interactions we report here will clearly not be as strong, which is why we describe them as interactions rather than bonds. However, examination of the intermolecular geometries suggests that they can be validly described as weak halogen interactions. This is shown when they are “switched on” by solvent loss through a decrease in the Br⋅⋅⋅Br distances to what amounts approximately to the sum of their Van der Waals radii and the fact that the Re‐Br‐Br angles switch from 110–140° to values close to linear. These concomitant changes provide good evidence that for the relevance of these halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interactions in these systems. Incorporating additional halogen interaction/bonding motifs offers a fruitful avenue of research into providing increased cooperativity between the Fe III centers.

Conclusions Our systematic approach which utilizes magnetic measurements and detailed structural investigations to observe compare and contrast the properties of similar systems showing the presence or absence of halogen⋅⋅⋅halogen interactions leads to a clear and concise understanding of the role which non‐typical supramolecular interactions can play in magnetic switching. The use of the {ReX 5 } − synthon in conjunction with a pocket ligand enabled us to provide an ideal Fe III SCO environment coupled with the possibility to switch on halogen⋅⋅⋅ halogen interactions through desolvation of the crystals. This engendered long‐range noncovalent interactions. The successful implementation of this approach to providing a facile way to include highly directional supramolecular interactions paves the way for future research into the role of such interactions within SCO and magnetically interesting compounds.

10.1002_chem.202003167,"Abstract Metal‐only Lewis pairs (MOLPs) in which the two metal fragments are solely connected by a dative M→M bond represent privileged architectures to acquire fundamental understanding of bimetallic bonding. This has important implications in many catalytic processes or supramolecular systems that rely on synergistic effects between two metals. However, a systematic experimental/computational approach on a well‐defined class of compounds is lacking. Here we report a family of MOLPs constructed around the Rh I precursor [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 ] ( 1 ) with a series of s , p and d ‐block metals, mostly from the main group elements, and investigate their bonding by computational means. Among the new MOLPs, we have structurally characterized those formed by dative bonding between 1 and MgMeBr, AlMe 3 , GeCl 2 , SnCl 2 , ZnMe 2 and Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2, as well as spectroscopically identified the ones resulting from coordination to MBAr F (M=Na, Li; BAr F  − =[B(C 6 H 2 ‐3,5‐(CF 3 ) 2 ) 4 ] − ) and CuCl. Some of these compounds represent unique examples of bimetallic structures, such as the first unambiguous cases of Rh→Mg dative bonding or base‐free rhodium bound germylene and stannylene species. Multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, including 103 Rh NMR, is used to probe the formation of Rh→M bonds. A comprehensive theoretical analysis of those provides clear trends. As anticipated, greater bond covalency is found for the more electronegative acids, whereas ionic character dominates for the least electronegative nuclei, though some degree of electron sharing is identified in all cases.","Introduction The unambiguous recognition of M−M bonding within the determination of the Mn 2 (CO) 10 structure [1]  [2]  2 Cl 8 ],[ 2  3  p ‐block. The area of metal‐to‐metal bonded compounds has discontinuously evolved since then, in a path teemed with milestones that include, to cite some paradigmatic examples, the first quintuple‐bonded dimetallic structure [Cr 2 {C 6 H 3 ‐2,6‐Dip 2 } 2 ] [4]  6 H 3 ‐2,6‐ i Pr 2 ) or the M I dimers [Zn 2 Cp* 2 ] [5]  η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 ] − ) and [Mg 2 ( Dip Nacnac) 2 ] [6]  Dip Nacnac=[(DipNCMe 2 ) 2 CH] − ) with a M I −M I bond. A fascinating class of metal–metal bonded complexes that is receiving growing attention are those with M→M dative bonds, also referred as metal‐only Lewis pairs (MOLPs). [7]  [8]  η  5 ‐C 5 H 5 )(CO) 2 Co→HgCl 2 ]. [9]  [10]  [11]  [12]  [13]  In addition, bimetallic dative bonding has implications in many catalytic processes that involve the participation of two metal fragments of contrasting electronic nature. For instance, a series of studies on Pd‐catalyzed Negishi and Sonogashira cross‐coupling reactions revealed the impact on catalytic performance of bimetallic Lewis acid‐base interactions between an electron rich Pd II center and acidic Zn II or Cu I fragments. [14]  [15]  [16]  [17]  [18]  [19]  [20]  With all this in mind, it becomes obvious that a deep understanding of the nature of metal‐to‐metal bond in these molecular compounds and supramolecular aggregations will have an important impact in a range of areas. In fact, this has been a matter of intense debate, which is not surprising considering the set of bonding components that may be involved (i.e. ionic, covalent, dative, dispersion…). As such, unsupported systems in which the bond between the two metals is the sole force holding the two fragments together constitute ideal motifs to study, since other factors that may obscure bonding analysis are excluded. In their original report, Nowell and Russell postulated that [( η  5 ‐C 5 H 5 )(CO) 2 Co→HgCl 2 ] could be considered a metallic Lewis acid–base adduct, [9]  18a  21  d  8 ‐ d  10 interactions (referred to the last filled subshell of the bonding metals). [22]  [23]  [24]  Most studies have either focused on the synthesis and structural characterization of a group of several MOLPs or on the computational analysis of previously reported bimetallic architectures of this kind. However, a more comprehensive and combined experimental/computational approach on a family of unsupported MOLPs is lacking. With this aim, we have selected the electron rich Rh I compound [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 ] [25]  1 ) as a Lewis base to investigate a variety of MOLPs generated by its combination with well‐known metallic and metalloid Lewis acids (Figure 103 Rh NMR) and structural characterization of these uncommon compounds, but also a computational analysis of their Rh I →M bonding. Metal Lewis basic (blue) and acidic (red) fragments employed in this work to access metal‐only Lewis pairs (MOLPs).

Results and Discussion The precise choice of 1 as the Lewis base to design MOLPs was made on the basis of several features: (i) the basic behavior of 1 has already been well established; [25]  3 ligands enhance the nucleophilicity [13a]  I site compared to its more widely explored carbonyl analogue [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(CO) 2 ]; [26]  η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 ) ligand prevents undesired reactivity recorded for its unsubstituted ( η  5 ‐C 5 H 5 ) analogue; [27]  I →M bond; (v) as a pentacoordinated 18‐electron species, insertion reactions into polar bonds of the Lewis acid, or the formation of intermediate alkyl or hydride bridging species [28]  I →M bond, will be less favored; and (vi) 103 Rh is NMR active ( I =1/2, 100 % abundant). With all this in mind, we have combined 1 with a variety of main group metal precursors as Lewis acids. With the exception of CuCl, we avoided the extensive use of transition metal electrophiles to circumvent more complex bonding pictures on grounds of their available d orbitals. Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with s ‐Block Acids The number of compounds exhibiting metalophilic interactions between transition and alkali metals is abundant. [29]  [30]  [31]  [32]  4 ] 3− with a naked Na + cation has been analyzed by computational means as the result of orbital overlapping. [22a]  3 ][Rh( η  4 ‐cod)Rh(P 3 Mes 3 )] reveals a short Rh−Na bond length of 3.105(2) Å, [33]  [30]  [34]  [35]  We decided to explore the possibility of accessing unsupported MOLPs containing lithium and sodium cations. To prevent artificial elongation of the Rh→M bond due to steric repulsion, [32b]  F  − ), while using non‐coordinating solvents. Addition of either one equivalent of NaBAr f or LiBAr f to bromobenzene solutions of 1 result in immediate color darkening. Complete consumption of 1 is evinced by a pronounced decrease in the 1  J  PRh coupling constant of around 80 Hz ( [A⋅Li] : 130 Hz; [A⋅Na] : 138 Hz; c.f . 1 : 1  J  PRh =216 Hz), a distinctive feature that applies to all MOLPs prepared herein (see Table 1 H NMR signal associated to the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ring, which resonates at 2.16 ppm for compound 1 ( c.f . [A⋅Li] : δ =1.61 ppm; [A⋅Na] : δ =1.67 ppm). We hypothesize compounds [A⋅Li] and [A⋅Na] to be the targeted alkali MOLPs (Scheme η  5 ‐coordination to the empty face of the Cp* ligand cannot be ruled out. At this stage, we defer a definitive proposal due to the lack of structural data. All our attempts to grow single crystals of these species were unsuccessful. We recovered in all cases either crystalline M[BAr F ] (M=Li, Na), which may illustrate the weakness of the Rh→Li/Na interaction, or observed the formation of the corresponding Rh III hydride [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 H][BAr F ] [24]  2 ), the latter formed due to the presence of adventitious water. Analogous cooperative reactivity has been reported for other MOLPs based on [Pt(P t Bu 3 ) 2 ]. [ 14a  14b  2 could be independently synthesized by addition of equimolar amounts of ammonium salts to 1 and it has been utilized as a benchmark species to investigate the bonding. Synthesis of metal‐only Lewis pairs by combination of 1 and s ‐block metal precursors (a) M[BAr F ] (M=Li, Na) and (b) MgMeBr. Rapid formation of hydride 2 in wet solvents in all MOLPs reported herein was ascertained by the appearance of a low‐frequency 1 H NMR signal recorded at −13.35 ppm ( 2  J  HP =23, 1  J  HRh =35 Hz). As noted earlier we aimed to access MOLPs by combining neutral fragments, aside from the prior Li + and Na + exceptions, to reduce the electrostatic component of the metal‐to‐metal bond. Reaction of 1 with two equivalents of the Grignard reagent MgMeBr readily yielded a new species 3 (Scheme 1  J  PRh coupling constant to 172 Hz, along with shifts of the 31 P{ 1 H} ( δ =−10.2 ppm) and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl 1 H ( δ =1.87 ppm) NMR signals towards lower frequencies. Despite the high instability of 3 , single crystals suitable for X‐ray diffraction studies were grown from diluted benzene solutions and revealed the dimeric structure [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )(PMe 3 ) 2 Rh→Mg(Me x Br 1− )( x μ ‐Br)] 2 (Figure [36]  1 , whereas the addition of MgBr 2 or MgMe 2 to access a MOLP without substitutional disorder proved unsuccessful, partly due to solubility issues.

Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with p ‐Block Acids Moving to the p ‐block we examined the reactivity of 1 with widely used metalloid precursors of the group 13 and 14, more precisely GeCl 2 ⋅dioxane, SnCl 2 , GaCl 3 , AlCl 3 and AlMe 3 . Whereas tricoordinated group 14 species has been widely exploited as Lewis acids, heavier tetrylenes (i.e. :GeCl 2 , :SnCl 2 ) exhibit ambiphilic behavior due to the joint presence of a lone electron pair and an empty p orbital. We thought of interest to access both types of MOLPs to later provide a comparison of the bonding scheme between each other. Reaction of 1 with either GaCl 3 or AlCl 3 resulted in the precipitation of a highly insoluble material or the formation of intractable mixtures, respectively. The latter is not surprising considering previously reported difficulties to access Rh–alane MOLPs by direct combination of the two metal fragments. [41]  3 (toluene solution, 1 m ) to a benzene solution of 1 resulted in clean formation of the corresponding 1⋅AlMe MOLP. The same occurs by adding GeCl 3 2 ⋅dioxane or SnCl 2 to bromobenzene solutions of the rhodium precursor to yield 1⋅GeCl and 2 1⋅SnCl , respectively, though the former required three hours for completion while the tin MOLP formed immediately. In the case of germanium, two equivalents of GeCl 2 2 ⋅dioxane were required to achieve full consumption of 1 , presumably because the second germanium may facilitate dioxane withdrawal from the coordinating GeCl 2 terminus (Scheme Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with tetrylenes dihalides and AlMe 3 . Multinuclear NMR spectroscopic analysis illustrates the formation of the new MOLPs exhibiting the same distinctive features commented above (Table 1  J  PRh coupling constant of ca. 40 Hz and a displacement to lower frequencies of the 1 H NMR signal due to the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ring. For the tin analogue we could also detect a broad 119 Sn{ 1 H} NMR signal at 810.7 ppm, whereas 1⋅AlMe provides a distinctive 3 1 H NMR singlet at −0.1 ppm due to the Al‐bound methyl termini, with a corresponding 13 C{ 1 H} NMR signal at 1.0 ppm. Interestingly, 103 Rh{ 1 H} NMR resonances due to the tetrylene MOLPs appear upshifted by ca. 400 ppm ( δ =−8756, 1⋅GeCl ; −8836 ppm, 2 1⋅SnCl ) compared to 2 1 ( δ =−9165 ppm), contrasting with all other main‐group based MOLPs reported herein (Table Single‐crystals of compounds 1⋅GeCl , 2 1⋅SnCl and 2 1⋅AlMe amenable to X‐ray diffraction studies where grown by slow diffusion of pentane into their benzene or bromobenzene solutions, once more revealing the piano stool configuration around the rhodium center after coordination to the Lewis acids (Figure 3 1⋅GeCl (2.501(1) Å) and 2 1⋅SnCl (2.687(3) Å) are slightly shorter than the sum of covalent radii ( 2 r  Rh+Ge =2.62; r  Rh+Sn =2.81 Å), [30]  1⋅AlMe (2.635(4) Å) is identical to the expected theoretical value for a covalent interaction (2.63 Å). 3 [30]  1⋅GeCl contains four independent molecules of the MOLP, being the aforementioned Rh‐Ge bond length the average for all of them. The solid‐state structures of 2 1⋅GeCl and 2 1⋅SnCl unveil a strong pyramidalization of the tetrel moiety, as seen in other related systems based on platinum. 2 [42]  [43]  [42d]  1⋅ECl (E=Ge, Sn). Since the lone pair on stannylene dichloride has more pronounced 2 s ‐character than that in its germylene analogue, the directionality of the former is decreased and as such a higher pyramidalization is anticipated for 1⋅SnCl . In fact, the pyramidalization angle estimated by the POAV method of Haddon 2 [44]  1⋅SnCl (26.2) surpass that of 2 1⋅GeCl (24.4). 2 To the best of our knowledge, compounds 1⋅GeCl and 2 1⋅SnCl represent the first examples of rhodium‐bound germylene and stannylene non‐stabilized by the coordination of a base. All prior structures containing Rh−E(II) (E=Ge, Sn) bonds involve tetrel centers bearing an additional intra‐ or intermolecular Lewis donor. 2 [45]  2 , but their dimeric nature preclude a clear understanding of the bonding situation.

This diminished acidity may explain the absence of previous unsupported transition metal MOLPs containing trimethylaluminum, being 1⋅AlMe the first of its kind. 3 [49]  3 as a methylating agent or in transition metal catalyzed polymerization. Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with d ‐Block Acids Turning into the d ‐block and keeping our aim to prepare Rh I MOLPS with neutral main group metal Lewis acids we decided to check the reactivity of 1 with two common zinc precursors, more precisely ZnMe 2 and Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2 . For the sake of completeness, we also examined the formation of metal adducts with simple forms of copper and silver. Complexes 1⋅ZnMe and 2 1⋅Zn(C were immediately formed after addition of one equivalent of the organometallic zinc substrate over a benzene solution of 6 F 5 ) 2 1 (Scheme 31 P{ 1 H} NMR signals at δ =−6.9 ( 1  J  PRh =192 Hz) and −7.2 ppm ( 1  J  PRh =167 Hz), respectively. The noticeable decrease of the 1  J  PRh coupling constants relative to 1 evidences formation of Rh→Zn MOLPs. Their corresponding 103 Rh{ 1 H} NMR resonances appear downshifted to −9212 ( 1⋅ZnMe ) and −9355 ( 2 1⋅Zn(C ) ppm. Other relevant NMR spectroscopic parameters are collected in Table 6 F 5 ) 2 Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with electrophiles ZnMe 2 , Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2 and CuCl. Reaction with group 11 precursors, whose acidity is also well‐recognized, proved more problematic. Reaction with CuOTf (OTf − =CF 3 SO 3  − ) or AgNTf 2 (NTf 2  − =(CF 3 SO 2 ) 2 N − ) resulted in complex mixtures that involve a number of rhodium compounds as inferred from the presence of several doublets in the corresponding 31 P{ 1 H} NMR spectra. In contrast, addition of one equivalent of CuCl over a bromobenzene solution of 1 cleanly provided a new species ( 1⋅CuCl ) characterized by a 31 P{ 1 H} NMR doublet at −3.0 ppm ( 1  J  PRh =144 Hz), once again suggesting the formation of a dative bond between the two metals (Scheme 103 Rh{ 1 H} signal resonates at −8540 ppm, shifted to higher frequencies compared to 1 . This contrasts with all other MOLPs described herein except those containing ambiphilic tetrylenes, which speaks in favor of some differences in the bonding situation between the MOLPs involving purely acidic fragments and those where some degree of back‐donation may be anticipated (i.e. those based on Ge, Sn and Cu). Crystals of 1⋅ZnMe and 2 1⋅Zn(C where grown by slow diffusion of pentane into their benzene solutions. The larger acidity of the fluorinated zinc moiety is reflected in a shorter Rh‐Zn bond length of 2.484(1) Å in 6 F 5 ) 2 1⋅Zn(C compared to that in 6 F 5 ) 2 1⋅ZnMe ( 2 d  RhZn =2.618(1) Å), attesting as well that steric effects may be less relevant (Figure [30]  38  50  I ‐catalyzed Negishi coupling reactions.[ 50e  51  [51b]  1⋅ZnMe or 2 1⋅Zn(C . Related to this, formation of a [Rh 6 F 5 ) 2 I ]→ZnCl 2 MOLP was postulated as a deactivation product during catalysis, although their molecular formulation could not be elucidated. Regarding the copper adduct, attempts to grow single crystals of 1⋅CuCl were unfruitful, partly because of the low solubility of the adduct which caused rapid precipitation in most cases. This fact, along with non‐definitive diffusion spectroscopic studies, prevented us to obtain a clear picture of its molecular structure. In principle, both a monomeric or dimeric nature could be proposed. To discern between these two possibilities, we made use of DFT calculations. However, attempts to optimize a dimeric species of type [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 Cu( μ ‐Cl)] 2 resulted in cleavage of the chloride bridges, supporting an unbridged formulation for 1⋅CuCl . It is interesting to note that this species represents a rare case of Rh→Cu MOLP, with prior complexes bearing a Rh−Cu bond typically relying on the stability conferred by bridging ligands, [52]  [53]  [54]  Computational analysis of Rh→M bonding in Rh I MOLPs Insight into the nature of the Rh→M interactions in the Rh I −M adducts has been obtained from DFT calculations, analysis of the calculated electron densities of the adducts within the Atoms In Molecules theory (AIM) [55]  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  [65]  7  29  F  − anion was excluded from the calculations to yield Rh−M distances of 2.46 and 2.76 Å respectively. When the BAr F  − was introduced in the Na system, the Rh−Na distance increased only slightly to 2.77 Å, still shorter than the sum of the covalent radii of Rh and Na. The CuCl adduct was considered as a monomeric species and the calculations afforded a Rh−M distance of 2.37 Å (∑ cov radii =2.74 Å). Topological analysis of the electron density was carried out with the AIM methods and the Multiwfn software[ 66  67  68  69  70  71  72  BCPs (blue dots) and bond paths (orange trace) of the electron density of 1⋅Na and 1⋅GeCl , 2 1⋅ZnMe and 2 1⋅CuCl superimposed on the function L =−∇ 2  ρ in one of the M‐Rh‐P planes. The orange arrows point to the Rh−M BCPs. Dotted blue and solid red contour lines are for positive and negative values of b L . The optimized geometries of the adducts are also shown. [78]  The existence of BCP and bond paths between two atoms has been interpreted as the necessary condition for them to form a chemical bond and several indicators based on the electron density have been used in the literature to characterize interatomic interactions.[ 55  73  2  ρ , and the total energy density, b H , as the sum of the electronic potential and kinetic energy densities, b G and b V . Thus, for open‐shell interactions (pure covalent bonds) ∇ b 2  ρ <0 (the electron density is locally concentrated) and for closed‐shell interactions ∇ b 2  ρ >0 (the electron density is locally depleted). Closed‐shell interactions are also characterized by electron densities at the BCPs, b ρ , of the order of 0.01 a.u., at least one order of magnitude smaller than in open‐shell interactions. Moreover, it has been argued that the sufficient condition for a bond to be considered covalent is b H <0, independently of the sign of the Laplacian.[ b 74  75  [76]  V |/ b G >1. Shared (metal–metal) and donor–acceptor (metal–ligand) interactions fall within this class. b [77]  As shown in Table ρ for our Rh−M interactions are small, ranging from 0.020 a.u. for b 1⋅Na to 0.072 a.u. for 1⋅GeCl . This, in addition to positive values for ∇ 2 2  ρ , is in agreement with closed‐shell interactions between the Rh and M atoms. b [55]  ρ values close to 0.1 a.u and ∇ b 2  ρ >0. Also, b ρ at the Rh−H bond of the Rh b III hydride 2 has a value of 0.150 a.u. and ∇ 2  ρ >0. Arguably, b [24a]  ρ and b H can be used to assess the strength of an interaction. b [79]  ρ follows the order Na b + <Li + <MgBr 2 <ZnMe 2 ≈AlMe 3 <Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2 ≈SnCl 2 <CuCl≈GeCl 2 ≪H, and it correlates with H , b [80]  ρ , b 1⋅Na (Figure QTAIM indicators at Rh I −M BCPs.

Wiley‐VCH GmbH Correlation of the total energy density, and electron density, ρ , at Rh−M BCPs of the Rh b I −M adducts and the Rh−H BCP of 2 (above); and correlation of the Pauling electronegativity difference (Δ χ  p = χ  P (M or H)− χ  P (Rh)) with the electron density, ρ , at Rh−M BCPs (below). b These results suggest that the least electronegative atoms (Li, Na, and Mg), with the smallest ρ and b H  b close to zero, form predominantly ionic interactions with Rh (although with some degree of electron sharing as it shall be discussed below), whereas the covalent character becomes more prominent as the electronegativity of the element bound to Rh increases and their electronegativity difference decreases (Δχ p =χ P (M or H)–χ P (Rh)). Indeed, reasonable correlations have been found between Δχ p and ρ or b H as shown in Figure b ρ (and Figure S4 for b H ). These correlations highlight a general trend, but they obviously fail to account for the complexity of the interactions. For example, they do not reflect the different acidity of the two Zn fragments and do not include the Rh−H bond of b 2 , since its associated H relative to those of the Rh−M bonds is higher than the corresponding electronegativity difference. b Another parameter that has been considered in this study is the delocalization index between the Rh and M, or H atoms, δ (Rh,M), which accounts for the extent of electron sharing between the atomic basins[ 81  82  δ (C,H) is close to 1, whereas purely ionic interactions have delocalization indices close to zero. Table δ (Rh,M) values stretching from less than 0.022 electrons for the adducts with s‐block metals to close to 0.8 electrons for the adducts with the two tetrylenes, attesting the higher covalent character of the latter interactions. The value calculated for the Rh−H bond of 2 , a covalent bond, is 0.91 electrons. Thus, the same trends as those emerging from ρ and b H are observed for b δ (Rh,M) including a linear dependence with Δ χ  p (Figure S4). When the Laplacian of the electron density is considered, all adducts yield positive values at the Rh−M (and Rh−H) BCPs, which is indicative of close‐shell interactions. In this case, no correlations arose between the Laplacian and other magnitudes derived from the electron density. Some correlations between the Laplacian and the electron density or the electronegativity difference have been found in coordination compounds [79]  V  b |/ G  b values (vide supra). One includes the adducts with s ‐block metals, which have | V  b |/ G  b values close to 1 ( H ≈0), characteristic of interactions with very low covalent character (for b 1⋅Na | V  b |/ G  b =0.98 a.u.), and a second group contains the remaining adducts with p ‐ and d ‐block metal, with |V |/G b values that range from 1.30 a.u. for b 1⋅ZnMe to 1.83 a.u. for 2 1⋅GeCl , typical of more covalent, intermediate interactions. For the sake of comparison Rh←P bonds in these systems, classical donor–acceptor interactions, have associated |V 2 |/G b values of about 1.5–1.6 a.u. The higher values for | b V  b |/ G  b have been found for the three p ‐block metals, with the value for the Rh−Ge interaction approaching the | V  b |/ G  b ≥2 (∇ 2  ρ ≤0) limit for shared‐shell (pure covalent) interactions. The | b V  b |/ G  b and ∇ 2  ρ values for the Rh−H bond of b 2 are 1.975 and 0.010 a.u. respectively. Natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis was performed at the DFT SMD‐ωB97XD/6–311 g(2d,p)/def2‐TZVP(ECP) level.[ 83  84  [85]  E ) can be calculated that are related to the strength of the interaction. ij Table I →M bonds. Typical NBO terminology has been used to name the different types of NBOs, such as LP for lone pair, and LV for lone vacancy, which refers to an empty valence orbital localized on one atom. Also, the main atomic orbital contribution to the LVs has been included in parenthesis. The NLMO column indicates the percentage of non‐Lewis orbitals from the acceptor atom that are mixed with the parent donor NBO. This section does not aim at being comprehensive, but to illustrate representative interactions and to offer a qualitative picture of the Rh−M bonding. For instance, more than one LP Rh →LV interaction has been located for most systems whereas only the most important is shown. Data for σ Rh‐P →LV interactions correspond to the average values of the interaction with the two Rh−P bonds in each adduct. Finally, back donation is by far one minor contribution to the Rh–tetrylene interactions, but it has been highlighted to illustrate the ambiphilic behavior of GeCl 2 and SnCl 2 in these adducts.

HOMOs (0.06 a.u. isovalue), and localized orbitals (0.05 a.u. isovalue) relevant to the Rh–tetrylene interactions in 1⋅GeCl and 2 1⋅SnCl . Notice the orbital mixing in the HOMOs compared to Figure 2 The NBO analysis locates 4 LPs, almost pure d orbitals, on the Rh atoms of all adducts, except for 1⋅GeCl and the hydride 2 2 , for which only 3 d LPs where found. This agrees with a Rh I formulation and d  8 electron count for most adducts and the expected Rh III , d  6 , formulation for the hydride. In the case of 1⋅GeCl , a Rh 2 III /Ge 0 formulation cannot be assumed. Instead, we propose that the [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 ] moiety forms one dative covalent bond with GeCl 2 , the latter acting effectively as an Z‐type ligand, [22a]  Inspection of the Rh d LPs of the formally Rh I adducts shows that at least one of them is populated by 1.82 electrons or less, except for 1⋅Li and 1⋅Na , for which the relevant lowest occupied Rh LPs have 1.95 electrons each. The occupancy is higher for the adducts of the more electropositive elements and lower for the adducts of the more electronegative ones, with the lowest occupancy found for 1⋅SnCl at 1.69 electrons. This reflects, once more, a higher degree of electron sharing in the adducts with the electronegative atoms. These Rh LPs are delocalized onto LV NBOs of the acceptor metal atoms. Thus, for 2 s ‐block atoms, the acceptor LV is mostly a valence s orbital, and the corresponding interaction can be described as d  (Rh) → s  (M) . The occupancy of the acceptor orbital and the major donor‐acceptor stabilization (or delocalization) energies (Δ E ) for these interactions are: 0.05 electrons and 6.00 kcal mol ij −1 for 1⋅Li ; 0.05 electrons and 6.71 kcal mol −1 for 1⋅Na ; and 0.40 electrons and 28.7 kcal mol −1 for the MgBr 2 adduct, 3 . However, in the above species, as well as in the remaining adducts considered, the Rh→M interaction is dominated, at least in terms of delocalization energies, not by Rh‐localized d orbitals, but by electron donation from the σ (Rh‐P) bonds, [31b]  sp ) and 28 % Rh ( sd ) character. For the Li, Na and MgBr 2 adducts the σ (Rh‐P) → s  (M) interaction have Δ E of 22.5, 19.3, 41.3 kcal mol ij −1 respectively. The NBO description of the Rh−M bonding in the adducts with p ‐block acceptor atoms is more varied than above. Thus, d  (Rh) → sp   3 (Al) and σ (Rh‐P) → sp   3 (Al) donor–acceptor interactions were located for 1⋅AlMe , with the latter being the major contribution in terms of delocalization energy (Δ 3 E are 33.7 and 80.6 kcal mol ij −1 respectively). The occupancies of the donor NBOs are 1.75 and 1.84 electrons for the Rh LP and the Al LV, a valence sp  3 hybrid, respectively. The Rh−M interactions in the adducts with the two tetrylenes, 1⋅SnCl and 2 1⋅GeCl , which were assigned the highest covalent character according to the AIM analysis, are described very differently by the NBO analysis: whereas the donor–acceptor description is used for the former, one bonding NBO was localized between Rh and Ge in the latter (Figure 2 d  (Rh) → p  (Sn) interaction in 1⋅SnCl (Δ 2 E =55.2 kcal mol ij −1 ) reveals that it has the highest mixing of acceptor metal orbitals of all analogous NLMOs in this study, with 81.9 % Rh and 15 % Sn composition, [86]  (Rh‐Ge) NBO of 1⋅GeCl has an even higher mixing of Ge orbitals, although it is heavily weighted towards the Rh atom: 71 % Rh (s 2 d  ) and 23 % Ge ( 2 p ), with about 2 % mixing from each P atom. This can be compared with the σ (Rh‐H) NBO of 2 , which has about 55 % Rh character and 45 % H character. The bonding in this case is pure covalent from the localized orbital perspective. Nevertheless, the σ (Rh‐P) → p  (Sn) interaction is also dominant in 1⋅SnCl , 2 [31b]  E =62.8 kcal mol ij −1 . The involvement of the Rh−P bonds in the Rh−Ge interaction of 1⋅GeCl is described in terms of donor–acceptor interactions: σ 2 (Rh‐Ge) →σ* (Rh‐P) and σ* (Rh‐Ge) ←σ (Rh‐P), and in the mixing of P orbitals in the NLMO associated to the σ (Rh‐Ge) NBO. According to these results, the interaction in 1⋅GeCl is best described as a dative covalent bond with the Rh fragment acting as an L ligand, and a similar description, with a lower degree of electron donation/sharing, could be used for 2 1⋅SnCl , that is, both can be equally described as MOLPs. 2 In addition, it is interesting to note that both tetrylenes have LPs which are mostly filled valence s orbitals, which back donate electron density onto antibonding σ* (Rh‐P) NBOs. [31b]  η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 ] is a minor contribution to the Rh−Ge and it es negligible, when detected (Δ E ≤1 kcal mol ij −1 ), in the remaining cases. In the adducts with d ‐block acceptor atoms, the donor‐acceptor interaction description has also been chosen. The Zn and Cu atoms of 1⋅ZnMe , 3 1⋅Zn(C and 6 F 5 ) 2 1⋅CuCl accept electron density onto their 4s valence orbitals from Rh LP ( d ) and σ (Rh‐P) NBOs. The degree of interaction, based on bond order, occupancy of the donor and acceptor orbitals and donor–acceptor stabilization energies is intermediate between those of s ‐block metals containing adducts and those of p ‐block metal containing adducts, for which is greatest. The magnitude of the Rh−M orbital interactions is reflected in the WBOs, which roughly follow the same trends as ρ and b δ (Rh,M), described above. Interestingly, some of these trends can be used to explain, at least qualitatively the variation of the Rh−P distances, which are shorter for adducts with smaller WBOs for their Rh−M bonds (or ρ and b δ (Rh,M)) and longer for adducts with larger WBOs (Figure I →M interactions become more important, there is a greater involvement of σ (Rh‐P) orbitals (and in some cases weak back donation onto σ* (Rh‐P) ), therefore weakening the Rh−P bonds.

Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with s ‐Block Acids The number of compounds exhibiting metalophilic interactions between transition and alkali metals is abundant. [29]  [30]  [31]  [32]  4 ] 3− with a naked Na + cation has been analyzed by computational means as the result of orbital overlapping.

To prevent artificial elongation of the Rh→M bond due to steric repulsion, [32b]  F  − ), while using non‐coordinating solvents. Addition of either one equivalent of NaBAr f or LiBAr f to bromobenzene solutions of 1 result in immediate color darkening. Complete consumption of 1 is evinced by a pronounced decrease in the 1  J  PRh coupling constant of around 80 Hz ( [A⋅Li] : 130 Hz; [A⋅Na] : 138 Hz; c.f . 1 : 1  J  PRh =216 Hz), a distinctive feature that applies to all MOLPs prepared herein (see Table 1 H NMR signal associated to the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ring, which resonates at 2.16 ppm for compound 1 ( c.f .

We hypothesize compounds [A⋅Li] and [A⋅Na] to be the targeted alkali MOLPs (Scheme η  5 ‐coordination to the empty face of the Cp* ligand cannot be ruled out. At this stage, we defer a definitive proposal due to the lack of structural data. All our attempts to grow single crystals of these species were unsuccessful. We recovered in all cases either crystalline M[BAr F ] (M=Li, Na), which may illustrate the weakness of the Rh→Li/Na interaction, or observed the formation of the corresponding Rh III hydride [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 H][BAr F ] [24]  2 ), the latter formed due to the presence of adventitious water. Analogous cooperative reactivity has been reported for other MOLPs based on [Pt(P t Bu 3 ) 2 ]. [ 14a  14b  2 could be independently synthesized by addition of equimolar amounts of ammonium salts to 1 and it has been utilized as a benchmark species to investigate the bonding. Synthesis of metal‐only Lewis pairs by combination of 1 and s ‐block metal precursors (a) M[BAr F ] (M=Li, Na) and (b) MgMeBr. Rapid formation of hydride 2 in wet solvents in all MOLPs reported herein was ascertained by the appearance of a low‐frequency 1 H NMR signal recorded at −13.35 ppm ( 2  J  HP =23, 1  J  HRh =35 Hz). As noted earlier we aimed to access MOLPs by combining neutral fragments, aside from the prior Li + and Na + exceptions, to reduce the electrostatic component of the metal‐to‐metal bond. Reaction of 1 with two equivalents of the Grignard reagent MgMeBr readily yielded a new species 3 (Scheme 1  J  PRh coupling constant to 172 Hz, along with shifts of the 31 P{ 1 H} ( δ =−10.2 ppm) and pentamethylcyclopentadienyl 1 H ( δ =1.87 ppm) NMR signals towards lower frequencies.

Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with p ‐Block Acids Moving to the p ‐block we examined the reactivity of 1 with widely used metalloid precursors of the group 13 and 14, more precisely GeCl 2 ⋅dioxane, SnCl 2 , GaCl 3 , AlCl 3 and AlMe 3 . Whereas tricoordinated group 14 species has been widely exploited as Lewis acids, heavier tetrylenes (i.e. :GeCl 2 , :SnCl 2 ) exhibit ambiphilic behavior due to the joint presence of a lone electron pair and an empty p orbital. We thought of interest to access both types of MOLPs to later provide a comparison of the bonding scheme between each other. Reaction of 1 with either GaCl 3 or AlCl 3 resulted in the precipitation of a highly insoluble material or the formation of intractable mixtures, respectively. The latter is not surprising considering previously reported difficulties to access Rh–alane MOLPs by direct combination of the two metal fragments. [41]  3 (toluene solution, 1 m ) to a benzene solution of 1 resulted in clean formation of the corresponding 1⋅AlMe MOLP. The same occurs by adding GeCl 3 2 ⋅dioxane or SnCl 2 to bromobenzene solutions of the rhodium precursor to yield 1⋅GeCl and 2 1⋅SnCl , respectively, though the former required three hours for completion while the tin MOLP formed immediately. In the case of germanium, two equivalents of GeCl 2 2 ⋅dioxane were required to achieve full consumption of 1 , presumably because the second germanium may facilitate dioxane withdrawal from the coordinating GeCl 2 terminus (Scheme Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with tetrylenes dihalides and AlMe 3 . Multinuclear NMR spectroscopic analysis illustrates the formation of the new MOLPs exhibiting the same distinctive features commented above (Table 1  J  PRh coupling constant of ca. 40 Hz and a displacement to lower frequencies of the 1 H NMR signal due to the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ring. For the tin analogue we could also detect a broad 119 Sn{ 1 H} NMR signal at 810.7 ppm, whereas 1⋅AlMe provides a distinctive 3 1 H NMR singlet at −0.1 ppm due to the Al‐bound methyl termini, with a corresponding 13 C{ 1 H} NMR signal at 1.0 ppm. Interestingly, 103 Rh{ 1 H} NMR resonances due to the tetrylene MOLPs appear upshifted by ca. 400 ppm ( δ =−8756, 1⋅GeCl ; −8836 ppm, 2 1⋅SnCl ) compared to 2 1 ( δ =−9165 ppm), contrasting with all other main‐group based MOLPs reported herein (Table Single‐crystals of compounds 1⋅GeCl , 2 1⋅SnCl and 2 1⋅AlMe amenable to X‐ray diffraction studies where grown by slow diffusion of pentane into their benzene or bromobenzene solutions, once more revealing the piano stool configuration around the rhodium center after coordination to the Lewis acids (Figure 3 1⋅GeCl (2.501(1) Å) and 2 1⋅SnCl (2.687(3) Å) are slightly shorter than the sum of covalent radii ( 2 r  Rh+Ge =2.62; r  Rh+Sn =2.81 Å), [30]  1⋅AlMe (2.635(4) Å) is identical to the expected theoretical value for a covalent interaction (2.63 Å). 3 [30]  1⋅GeCl contains four independent molecules of the MOLP, being the aforementioned Rh‐Ge bond length the average for all of them. The solid‐state structures of 2 1⋅GeCl and 2 1⋅SnCl unveil a strong pyramidalization of the tetrel moiety, as seen in other related systems based on platinum. 2 [42]  [43]  [42d]  1⋅ECl (E=Ge, Sn). Since the lone pair on stannylene dichloride has more pronounced 2 s ‐character than that in its germylene analogue, the directionality of the former is decreased and as such a higher pyramidalization is anticipated for 1⋅SnCl . In fact, the pyramidalization angle estimated by the POAV method of Haddon 2 [44]  1⋅SnCl (26.2) surpass that of 2 1⋅GeCl (24.4). 2 To the best of our knowledge, compounds 1⋅GeCl and 2 1⋅SnCl represent the first examples of rhodium‐bound germylene and stannylene non‐stabilized by the coordination of a base. All prior structures containing Rh−E(II) (E=Ge, Sn) bonds involve tetrel centers bearing an additional intra‐ or intermolecular Lewis donor. 2 [45]  2 , but their dimeric nature preclude a clear understanding of the bonding situation.

Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with d ‐Block Acids Turning into the d ‐block and keeping our aim to prepare Rh I MOLPS with neutral main group metal Lewis acids we decided to check the reactivity of 1 with two common zinc precursors, more precisely ZnMe 2 and Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2 . For the sake of completeness, we also examined the formation of metal adducts with simple forms of copper and silver. Complexes 1⋅ZnMe and 2 1⋅Zn(C were immediately formed after addition of one equivalent of the organometallic zinc substrate over a benzene solution of 6 F 5 ) 2 1 (Scheme 31 P{ 1 H} NMR signals at δ =−6.9 ( 1  J  PRh =192 Hz) and −7.2 ppm ( 1  J  PRh =167 Hz), respectively. The noticeable decrease of the 1  J  PRh coupling constants relative to 1 evidences formation of Rh→Zn MOLPs. Their corresponding 103 Rh{ 1 H} NMR resonances appear downshifted to −9212 ( 1⋅ZnMe ) and −9355 ( 2 1⋅Zn(C ) ppm. Other relevant NMR spectroscopic parameters are collected in Table 6 F 5 ) 2 Synthesis of Rh I MOLPs with electrophiles ZnMe 2 , Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2 and CuCl. Reaction with group 11 precursors, whose acidity is also well‐recognized, proved more problematic. Reaction with CuOTf (OTf − =CF 3 SO 3  − ) or AgNTf 2 (NTf 2  − =(CF 3 SO 2 ) 2 N − ) resulted in complex mixtures that involve a number of rhodium compounds as inferred from the presence of several doublets in the corresponding 31 P{ 1 H} NMR spectra. In contrast, addition of one equivalent of CuCl over a bromobenzene solution of 1 cleanly provided a new species ( 1⋅CuCl ) characterized by a 31 P{ 1 H} NMR doublet at −3.0 ppm ( 1  J  PRh =144 Hz), once again suggesting the formation of a dative bond between the two metals (Scheme 103 Rh{ 1 H} signal resonates at −8540 ppm, shifted to higher frequencies compared to 1 . This contrasts with all other MOLPs described herein except those containing ambiphilic tetrylenes, which speaks in favor of some differences in the bonding situation between the MOLPs involving purely acidic fragments and those where some degree of back‐donation may be anticipated (i.e. those based on Ge, Sn and Cu). Crystals of 1⋅ZnMe and 2 1⋅Zn(C where grown by slow diffusion of pentane into their benzene solutions. The larger acidity of the fluorinated zinc moiety is reflected in a shorter Rh‐Zn bond length of 2.484(1) Å in 6 F 5 ) 2 1⋅Zn(C compared to that in 6 F 5 ) 2 1⋅ZnMe ( 2 d  RhZn =2.618(1) Å), attesting as well that steric effects may be less relevant (Figure [30]  38  50  I ‐catalyzed Negishi coupling reactions.[ 50e  51  [51b]  1⋅ZnMe or 2 1⋅Zn(C . Related to this, formation of a [Rh 6 F 5 ) 2 I ]→ZnCl 2 MOLP was postulated as a deactivation product during catalysis, although their molecular formulation could not be elucidated. Regarding the copper adduct, attempts to grow single crystals of 1⋅CuCl were unfruitful, partly because of the low solubility of the adduct which caused rapid precipitation in most cases. This fact, along with non‐definitive diffusion spectroscopic studies, prevented us to obtain a clear picture of its molecular structure. In principle, both a monomeric or dimeric nature could be proposed. To discern between these two possibilities, we made use of DFT calculations. However, attempts to optimize a dimeric species of type [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 Cu( μ ‐Cl)] 2 resulted in cleavage of the chloride bridges, supporting an unbridged formulation for 1⋅CuCl . It is interesting to note that this species represents a rare case of Rh→Cu MOLP, with prior complexes bearing a Rh−Cu bond typically relying on the stability conferred by bridging ligands, [52]  [53]  [54] 

Computational analysis of Rh→M bonding in Rh I MOLPs Insight into the nature of the Rh→M interactions in the Rh I −M adducts has been obtained from DFT calculations, analysis of the calculated electron densities of the adducts within the Atoms In Molecules theory (AIM) [55]  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  [65]  7  29  F  − anion was excluded from the calculations to yield Rh−M distances of 2.46 and 2.76 Å respectively. When the BAr F  − was introduced in the Na system, the Rh−Na distance increased only slightly to 2.77 Å, still shorter than the sum of the covalent radii of Rh and Na. The CuCl adduct was considered as a monomeric species and the calculations afforded a Rh−M distance of 2.37 Å (∑ cov radii =2.74 Å). Topological analysis of the electron density was carried out with the AIM methods and the Multiwfn software[ 66  67  68  69  70  71  72  BCPs (blue dots) and bond paths (orange trace) of the electron density of 1⋅Na and 1⋅GeCl , 2 1⋅ZnMe and 2 1⋅CuCl superimposed on the function L =−∇ 2  ρ in one of the M‐Rh‐P planes. The orange arrows point to the Rh−M BCPs. Dotted blue and solid red contour lines are for positive and negative values of b L . The optimized geometries of the adducts are also shown. [78]  The existence of BCP and bond paths between two atoms has been interpreted as the necessary condition for them to form a chemical bond and several indicators based on the electron density have been used in the literature to characterize interatomic interactions.[ 55  73  2  ρ , and the total energy density, b H , as the sum of the electronic potential and kinetic energy densities, b G and b V . Thus, for open‐shell interactions (pure covalent bonds) ∇ b 2  ρ <0 (the electron density is locally concentrated) and for closed‐shell interactions ∇ b 2  ρ >0 (the electron density is locally depleted). Closed‐shell interactions are also characterized by electron densities at the BCPs, b ρ , of the order of 0.01 a.u., at least one order of magnitude smaller than in open‐shell interactions. Moreover, it has been argued that the sufficient condition for a bond to be considered covalent is b H <0, independently of the sign of the Laplacian.[ b 74  75  [76]  V |/ b G >1. Shared (metal–metal) and donor–acceptor (metal–ligand) interactions fall within this class. b [77]  As shown in Table ρ for our Rh−M interactions are small, ranging from 0.020 a.u. for b 1⋅Na to 0.072 a.u. for 1⋅GeCl . This, in addition to positive values for ∇ 2 2  ρ , is in agreement with closed‐shell interactions between the Rh and M atoms. b [55]  ρ values close to 0.1 a.u and ∇ b 2  ρ >0. Also, b ρ at the Rh−H bond of the Rh b III hydride 2 has a value of 0.150 a.u. and ∇ 2  ρ >0. Arguably, b [24a]  ρ and b H can be used to assess the strength of an interaction. b [79]  ρ follows the order Na b + <Li + <MgBr 2 <ZnMe 2 ≈AlMe 3 <Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2 ≈SnCl 2 <CuCl≈GeCl 2 ≪H, and it correlates with H , b [80]  ρ , b 1⋅Na (Figure QTAIM indicators at Rh I −M BCPs.

Wiley‐VCH GmbH Correlation of the total energy density, and electron density, ρ , at Rh−M BCPs of the Rh b I −M adducts and the Rh−H BCP of 2 (above); and correlation of the Pauling electronegativity difference (Δ χ  p = χ  P (M or H)− χ  P (Rh)) with the electron density, ρ , at Rh−M BCPs (below). b These results suggest that the least electronegative atoms (Li, Na, and Mg), with the smallest ρ and b H  b close to zero, form predominantly ionic interactions with Rh (although with some degree of electron sharing as it shall be discussed below), whereas the covalent character becomes more prominent as the electronegativity of the element bound to Rh increases and their electronegativity difference decreases (Δχ p =χ P (M or H)–χ P (Rh)). Indeed, reasonable correlations have been found between Δχ p and ρ or b H as shown in Figure b ρ (and Figure S4 for b H ). These correlations highlight a general trend, but they obviously fail to account for the complexity of the interactions. For example, they do not reflect the different acidity of the two Zn fragments and do not include the Rh−H bond of b 2 , since its associated H relative to those of the Rh−M bonds is higher than the corresponding electronegativity difference. b Another parameter that has been considered in this study is the delocalization index between the Rh and M, or H atoms, δ (Rh,M), which accounts for the extent of electron sharing between the atomic basins[ 81  82  δ (C,H) is close to 1, whereas purely ionic interactions have delocalization indices close to zero. Table δ (Rh,M) values stretching from less than 0.022 electrons for the adducts with s‐block metals to close to 0.8 electrons for the adducts with the two tetrylenes, attesting the higher covalent character of the latter interactions. The value calculated for the Rh−H bond of 2 , a covalent bond, is 0.91 electrons. Thus, the same trends as those emerging from ρ and b H are observed for b δ (Rh,M) including a linear dependence with Δ χ  p (Figure S4). When the Laplacian of the electron density is considered, all adducts yield positive values at the Rh−M (and Rh−H) BCPs, which is indicative of close‐shell interactions. In this case, no correlations arose between the Laplacian and other magnitudes derived from the electron density. Some correlations between the Laplacian and the electron density or the electronegativity difference have been found in coordination compounds [79]  V  b |/ G  b values (vide supra). One includes the adducts with s ‐block metals, which have | V  b |/ G  b values close to 1 ( H ≈0), characteristic of interactions with very low covalent character (for b 1⋅Na | V  b |/ G  b =0.98 a.u.), and a second group contains the remaining adducts with p ‐ and d ‐block metal, with |V |/G b values that range from 1.30 a.u. for b 1⋅ZnMe to 1.83 a.u. for 2 1⋅GeCl , typical of more covalent, intermediate interactions. For the sake of comparison Rh←P bonds in these systems, classical donor–acceptor interactions, have associated |V 2 |/G b values of about 1.5–1.6 a.u. The higher values for | b V  b |/ G  b have been found for the three p ‐block metals, with the value for the Rh−Ge interaction approaching the | V  b |/ G  b ≥2 (∇ 2  ρ ≤0) limit for shared‐shell (pure covalent) interactions. The | b V  b |/ G  b and ∇ 2  ρ values for the Rh−H bond of b 2 are 1.975 and 0.010 a.u. respectively. Natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis was performed at the DFT SMD‐ωB97XD/6–311 g(2d,p)/def2‐TZVP(ECP) level.[ 83  84  [85]  E ) can be calculated that are related to the strength of the interaction. ij Table I →M bonds. Typical NBO terminology has been used to name the different types of NBOs, such as LP for lone pair, and LV for lone vacancy, which refers to an empty valence orbital localized on one atom. Also, the main atomic orbital contribution to the LVs has been included in parenthesis. The NLMO column indicates the percentage of non‐Lewis orbitals from the acceptor atom that are mixed with the parent donor NBO. This section does not aim at being comprehensive, but to illustrate representative interactions and to offer a qualitative picture of the Rh−M bonding. For instance, more than one LP Rh →LV interaction has been located for most systems whereas only the most important is shown. Data for σ Rh‐P →LV interactions correspond to the average values of the interaction with the two Rh−P bonds in each adduct. Finally, back donation is by far one minor contribution to the Rh–tetrylene interactions, but it has been highlighted to illustrate the ambiphilic behavior of GeCl 2 and SnCl 2 in these adducts.

HOMOs (0.06 a.u. isovalue), and localized orbitals (0.05 a.u. isovalue) relevant to the Rh–tetrylene interactions in 1⋅GeCl and 2 1⋅SnCl . Notice the orbital mixing in the HOMOs compared to Figure 2 The NBO analysis locates 4 LPs, almost pure d orbitals, on the Rh atoms of all adducts, except for 1⋅GeCl and the hydride 2 2 , for which only 3 d LPs where found. This agrees with a Rh I formulation and d  8 electron count for most adducts and the expected Rh III , d  6 , formulation for the hydride. In the case of 1⋅GeCl , a Rh 2 III /Ge 0 formulation cannot be assumed. Instead, we propose that the [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 ] moiety forms one dative covalent bond with GeCl 2 , the latter acting effectively as an Z‐type ligand, [22a]  Inspection of the Rh d LPs of the formally Rh I adducts shows that at least one of them is populated by 1.82 electrons or less, except for 1⋅Li and 1⋅Na , for which the relevant lowest occupied Rh LPs have 1.95 electrons each. The occupancy is higher for the adducts of the more electropositive elements and lower for the adducts of the more electronegative ones, with the lowest occupancy found for 1⋅SnCl at 1.69 electrons. This reflects, once more, a higher degree of electron sharing in the adducts with the electronegative atoms. These Rh LPs are delocalized onto LV NBOs of the acceptor metal atoms. Thus, for 2 s ‐block atoms, the acceptor LV is mostly a valence s orbital, and the corresponding interaction can be described as d  (Rh) → s  (M) . The occupancy of the acceptor orbital and the major donor‐acceptor stabilization (or delocalization) energies (Δ E ) for these interactions are: 0.05 electrons and 6.00 kcal mol ij −1 for 1⋅Li ; 0.05 electrons and 6.71 kcal mol −1 for 1⋅Na ; and 0.40 electrons and 28.7 kcal mol −1 for the MgBr 2 adduct, 3 . However, in the above species, as well as in the remaining adducts considered, the Rh→M interaction is dominated, at least in terms of delocalization energies, not by Rh‐localized d orbitals, but by electron donation from the σ (Rh‐P) bonds, [31b]  sp ) and 28 % Rh ( sd ) character. For the Li, Na and MgBr 2 adducts the σ (Rh‐P) → s  (M) interaction have Δ E of 22.5, 19.3, 41.3 kcal mol ij −1 respectively. The NBO description of the Rh−M bonding in the adducts with p ‐block acceptor atoms is more varied than above. Thus, d  (Rh) → sp   3 (Al) and σ (Rh‐P) → sp   3 (Al) donor–acceptor interactions were located for 1⋅AlMe , with the latter being the major contribution in terms of delocalization energy (Δ 3 E are 33.7 and 80.6 kcal mol ij −1 respectively). The occupancies of the donor NBOs are 1.75 and 1.84 electrons for the Rh LP and the Al LV, a valence sp  3 hybrid, respectively. The Rh−M interactions in the adducts with the two tetrylenes, 1⋅SnCl and 2 1⋅GeCl , which were assigned the highest covalent character according to the AIM analysis, are described very differently by the NBO analysis: whereas the donor–acceptor description is used for the former, one bonding NBO was localized between Rh and Ge in the latter (Figure 2 d  (Rh) → p  (Sn) interaction in 1⋅SnCl (Δ 2 E =55.2 kcal mol ij −1 ) reveals that it has the highest mixing of acceptor metal orbitals of all analogous NLMOs in this study, with 81.9 % Rh and 15 % Sn composition, [86]  (Rh‐Ge) NBO of 1⋅GeCl has an even higher mixing of Ge orbitals, although it is heavily weighted towards the Rh atom: 71 % Rh (s 2 d  ) and 23 % Ge ( 2 p ), with about 2 % mixing from each P atom. This can be compared with the σ (Rh‐H) NBO of 2 , which has about 55 % Rh character and 45 % H character. The bonding in this case is pure covalent from the localized orbital perspective. Nevertheless, the σ (Rh‐P) → p  (Sn) interaction is also dominant in 1⋅SnCl , 2 [31b]  E =62.8 kcal mol ij −1 . The involvement of the Rh−P bonds in the Rh−Ge interaction of 1⋅GeCl is described in terms of donor–acceptor interactions: σ 2 (Rh‐Ge) →σ* (Rh‐P) and σ* (Rh‐Ge) ←σ (Rh‐P), and in the mixing of P orbitals in the NLMO associated to the σ (Rh‐Ge) NBO. According to these results, the interaction in 1⋅GeCl is best described as a dative covalent bond with the Rh fragment acting as an L ligand, and a similar description, with a lower degree of electron donation/sharing, could be used for 2 1⋅SnCl , that is, both can be equally described as MOLPs. 2 In addition, it is interesting to note that both tetrylenes have LPs which are mostly filled valence s orbitals, which back donate electron density onto antibonding σ* (Rh‐P) NBOs. [31b]  η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) 2 ] is a minor contribution to the Rh−Ge and it es negligible, when detected (Δ E ≤1 kcal mol ij −1 ), in the remaining cases. In the adducts with d ‐block acceptor atoms, the donor‐acceptor interaction description has also been chosen. The Zn and Cu atoms of 1⋅ZnMe , 3 1⋅Zn(C and 6 F 5 ) 2 1⋅CuCl accept electron density onto their 4s valence orbitals from Rh LP ( d ) and σ (Rh‐P) NBOs. The degree of interaction, based on bond order, occupancy of the donor and acceptor orbitals and donor–acceptor stabilization energies is intermediate between those of s ‐block metals containing adducts and those of p ‐block metal containing adducts, for which is greatest. The magnitude of the Rh−M orbital interactions is reflected in the WBOs, which roughly follow the same trends as ρ and b δ (Rh,M), described above. Interestingly, some of these trends can be used to explain, at least qualitatively the variation of the Rh−P distances, which are shorter for adducts with smaller WBOs for their Rh−M bonds (or ρ and b δ (Rh,M)) and longer for adducts with larger WBOs (Figure I →M interactions become more important, there is a greater involvement of σ (Rh‐P) orbitals (and in some cases weak back donation onto σ* (Rh‐P) ), therefore weakening the Rh−P bonds. Calculated Rh−P distances versus Rh−M(H) Wiberg bond orders.

Conclusions The choice of [( η  5 ‐C 5 Me 5 )Rh(PMe 3 ) as a Lewis base for the synthesis of unsupported MOLPs has proved highly successful. We have prepared up to nine Rh‐based bimetallic compounds of this kind, providing X‐ray diffraction structures for those containing fragments MgMeBr, Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2 , ZnMe 2 , GeCl 2 , SnCl 2 and AlMe 3 . It is surprising that despite the wide use of some of these Lewis acidic fragments, their corresponding MOLPs represent highly unusual examples of unsupported M−M bonding, particularly in cases like those with a Rh→Mg ( 3 ) or a Rh→Al ( 1⋅AlMe ) dative bonds. The growing interest on MOLPs is reflected by increased number of studies focusing either on accessing new structures or computationally investigating families of compounds already prepared, whereas a combined effort on a series of MOLPs is still lacking. We provide here a comprehensive computational investigation on the Rh−M bonding of the prepared Rh MOLPs, with several sound correlations found for relevant parameters associated to the metal‐to‐metal bond. For instance, the more electronegative atoms (Ge, Sn, Al) tend to form more covalent bonds with rhodium, whereas the ionic character becomes more prominent in the least electronegative (Li, Na, Mg). Nevertheless, we have quantified some degree of electron sharing for all investigated MOLPs. Curiously, the Rh→M bond is dominated by electron donation from the Rh−P σ‐bonds rather than from a filled Rh 3 d ‐orbital to the acidic site, which results in other relevant correlation between Wiberg Bond Orders and Rh−P bond lengths. Overall, we believe that this combined experimental/computational approach to Rh‐based MOLPs will aid in the development of other related systems for the advancement of this growing field.

Experimental Section  General considerations : All preparations and manipulations were carried out using standard Schlenk and glove‐box techniques, under an atmosphere of argon and of high purity nitrogen, respectively. All solvents were dried, stored over 4 Å molecular sieves, and degassed prior to use. Toluene (C 7 H 8 ) and n ‐pentane (C 5 H 12 ) were distilled under nitrogen over sodium. [D 6 ]Benzene were dried over molecular sieves (4 Å). Tin dichloride was dried by vigorous stirring with acetic anhydride, while copper(I) chloride by co‐evaporation with toluene and drying under vacuum. Other chemicals were commercially available and used as received. For elemental analyses a LECO TruSpec CHN elementary analyzer, was utilized.  NMR Spectroscopy : Solution NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AMX‐300, DRX‐400 and DRX‐500 spectrometers. Spectra were referenced to external SiMe 4 ( δ : 0 ppm) using the residual proton solvent peaks as internal standards ( 1 H NMR experiments), or the characteristic resonances of the solvent nuclei ( 13 C NMR experiments), whereas 31 P was referenced to H 3 PO 4 . Spectral assignments were made by routine one‐ and two‐dimensional NMR experiments where appropriate. 103 Rh NMR was acquired at 15.9 MHz using an observe 5 mm triple resonance broadband probe (broadband inner coil and doubly tuned 1 H/ 31 P outer coil) with 90° pulses of 37.5 μs and 30.0 μs for 103 Rh and 31 P, respectively. 103 Rh chemical shifts, δ , are given in ppm relative to Ξ =3.186447 [87]  3 , where acac stands for [CH 3 COCHCOCH 3 ] − ) and derived indirectly from the 31 P‐ 103 Rh HMQC experiments by four pulse 31 P− 103 Rh HMQC experiments with 1 H decoupling during acquisition. Note that despite the fact that IUPAC recommends the use of Rh(acac) 3 as the reference, the alternative Xi value Ξ =3.160000 for Rh metal has been commonly employed in the literature. The experiments were optimized using the 1  J  RhP values obtained from the corresponding 31 P{ 1 H} spectra. The transmitter frequency offset and the spectral width were varied to ensure that no signals were folded. 2D data were zero filled and processed with exponential line broadening of 10 Hz in the direct F2 dimension, and unshifted sine‐bell window function in the indirect F1 dimension.  General synthesis of rhodium MOLPs. Method A : A solid mixture of 1 (30 mg, 0.077 mmol) and the corresponding Lewis acid (0.077 mmol: GeCl 2 ⋅dioxane, 36 mg; SnCl 2 , 15 mg; CuCl, 7.6 mg; Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2 , 30 mg) is placed in a Schlenk flask and dissolved in toluene (4 mL; for Zn(C 6 F 5 ) 2 ) or bromobenzene (4 mL; for GeCl 2 , SnCl 2 and CuCl) under argon atmosphere. The solution is stirred for one hour at 25 °C and pentane (10 mL) is subsequently added. The resulting solid is filtrated, dried under vacuum and washed with pentane to provide the resultant MOLPs as orange to brown solids in moderate to good yields (vide infra). Method B . A toluene (4 mL) solution of 1 (30 mg, 0.077 mmol) placed in a Schlenk flask was charged with a solution of the corresponding Lewis acid (ZnMe 2 , AlMe 3 or MeMgBr, 1 m in toluene or Et 2 O, 77 μL, 0.077 mmol) and stirred for one hour at 25 °C. Then pentane (10 mL) is added and the resulting solid filtrated, dried under reduced pressure and washed with pentane to provide the resultant MOLPs as orange to brown solids in moderate to good yields (vide infra). In the case of ZnMe 2 drying of the MOLP is carried out by a flow of argon, since under reduced pressure ZnMe 2 is readily eliminated. Single crystals of compounds 1⋅GeCl , 2 1⋅SnCl , 2 1⋅AlMe , 3 1⋅ZnMe , 2 1⋅Zn(C and 6 F 5 ) 2 3 were grown from slow diffusion of pentane into their benzene or bromobenzene solutions. The analogous procedures carried out in J. Young NMR tubes between 1 (14 mg, 0.036 mmol) and equimolar amounts of the corresponding Lewis acids lead in all cases to formation of the reported MOLPs in quantitative spectroscopic yields.

10.1002_cssc.202201821,"Abstract One of the key challenges preventing the breakthrough of magnesium‐ion batteries (MIB) is the formation of a passivating boundary layer at the Mg anode. To describe the initial steps of Mg anode degradation by O 2 impurities, a Mg/O ReaxFF (force field for reactive systems) parameter set was developed capable of accurately modeling the bulk, surface, adsorption, and diffusion properties of metallic Mg and the salt MgO. It is shown that O 2 immediately dissociates upon first contact with the Mg anode (modeled as Mg(0001), Mg(10 0)A, and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1)), heating the surface to several 1000 K. The high temperature assists the further oxidation and forms a rock salt interphase intersected by several grain boundaries. Among the Mg surface terminations, Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)A is the most reactive, forming an MgO layer with a thickness of up to 25 Å. The trained force field can be used to model the ongoing reactions in Mg–air batteries but also to study the oxidation of magnesium metal in general. 1 ‾","Introduction The search for new energy storage technologies to promote electromobility and reduce global warming is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Magnesium‐ion batteries (MIB) are attracting increasing attention as an alternative to conventional lithium‐ion batteries (LIB) due to the unique properties of magnesium metal anodes, such as high volumetric capacity, low cost, and safe operation.[ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  [9]  First, Mg has a higher charge density due to its bi‐valency, which leads not only to stronger coordination with solvent molecules and salt anions but also facilitates solvent decomposition at the anode. [10]  4 is chemically reduced at the Mg anode in carbonate‐containing solvents, forming a solid‐electrolyte interface (SEI) consisting of Mg‐halides, MgO, Mg(OH) 2 , MgCO 3 , and Mg(ROCO 2 ) 2 . [11]  Second, short circuits are induced by non‐uniform Mg growth, which can be further subdivided into hemispherical, [12]  [13]  [14]  [9]  [12]  2 salt electrolyte with MgCl 2 as additive, continuous stripping and plating leads to fracturing and reformation of the SEI layer, resulting in large effective current densities at the respective fracture sites and inhomogeneous Mg deposition. [13]  −3 solution of MeMgCl in THF at a current density of 0.921 mA cm −2 . [14]  Third, corrosion of the Mg surface upon contact with ambient air leads to the formation of inorganic compounds such as MgO and Mg(OH) 2 at the interface. [9]  2 or H 2 O can hardly be avoided. In addition, traces of water in the electrolytes or oxygen residues under inert gas conditions can also lead to passivation.[ 15  16  [17]  To study in detail the initial steps of the Mg anode passivation by oxygen impurities, we apply ReaxFF, a bond‐order based reactive force field method capable of large‐scale molecular dynamics simulations (cf. computational details).[ 53  54  [18]  19  20  + /EC − radical, and predicted possible radical termination products which were also detected experimentally.

[25]  [26]  6 salts. [27]  The oxidation of magnesium is not only of central importance in battery science but also in automotive and aerospace research. [28]  29  30  31  32  Until now, no suitable Mg/O parameters have been available to describe the passivation at the Mg anode. So far, only Cheung et al. have trained force field parameters for magnesium hydride systems [33]  4 hydrates. [34]  [35]  [36]  The goal of the present study is to describe the initial steps of Mg anode degradation by oxygen impurities. To this end, we trained a reactive ReaxFF Mg/O force field that can accurately describe the properties of metallic Mg and MgO. The comprehensive training set included a variety of bulk, surface, and adsorption energies as well as diffusion barriers calculated at the level of density functional theory (DFT). In addition, we demonstrated the applicability of our force field by first completely oxidizing a Mg particle in a grand‐canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation and then recrystallizing it into the thermodynamically stable rock salt structure by simulated thermal annealing at 2000 K in a subsequent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.

Results and Discussion The following section first compares the DFT training data with the force field optimization results. In this context, we discuss the performance and limitations of the obtained ReaxFF parameters. We subsequently demonstrate the functionality of the force field by oxidizing a Mg nanoparticle in a GCMC simulation and then recrystallizing it into the thermodynamically stable rock salt structure in a subsequent MD simulation. Afterwards, we simulate and discuss the first steps of Mg anode passivation. All fitted ReaxFF force field parameters for the Mg/O interactions are given in the Supporting Information. Magnesium‐magnesium interactions The first milestone of ReaxFF parameter training for the Mg/Mg metal interactions was to reproduce the bulk properties of Mg. Therefore, lattice constants, cohesive energies [(Eq. (3)], and bulk moduli of the crystal phases hexagonal close‐packed (hcp), face centered cubic (fcc), body centered cubic (bcc), β ‐tungsten type (a15), and simple cubic (sc) were introduced to the training set. Figure a  0 / c  0 ) of the lattice constants a  0 and c  0 in the hcp unit cell always corresponds with (8 / 3) 1 to the ideal value of a closed‐packed crystal, and second, the hcp and fcc cohesive energy will be identical. / 2 [37]  Equations of state (EOS) for bulk Mg crystal phases calculated with a) the trained ReaxFF force field and b) DFT.

The cohesive energy, in particular, is an important measure to describe bond strengths, and was therefore weighted more strongly during the training process; it varies at most by 0.01 eV for all crystal phases. This is also reflected in the relative stability between the crystal phases, which are in good agreement. ReaxFF slightly overestimates the bulk modulus for all crystal phases. This behavior is illustrated in the equation of state (EOS) curves presented in Figure In addition, we trained surface energies of the low index surfaces Mg(0001), Mg(10 0)A, Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)B, Mg(10 1 ‾ 1), Mg(10 1 ‾ 0), and Mg(10 2 ‾ 1), which were calculated using Equation (6).

Wiley‐VCH GmbH To obtain a smooth potential energy surface (PES), which is key to performing meaningful MD simulations, we added activation energies of selected self‐diffusion processes to the training set, calculated using Equation (8). Our goal was to introduce a diverse spectrum of different magnesium conformations but also of transition states into the training set. For the latter, we included terrace self‐diffusion barriers on Mg(0001), Mg(10 0)A, and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) (Figure 1 ‾ [42]  1)). To keep this section compact, we discuss only the performance of the terrace self‐diffusion barriers in the main text but refer to the Supporting Information for the additional diffusion processes (Figure S4, Table S1 for Mg(0001); Figure S5, Table S2 for Mg(10 1 ‾ 1)). Overall, the trained force field reproduces the reference DFT activation energies of 32 of the 37 processes to an accuracy of 1 ‾ | ▵ E  a  | ≤0.2 eV. As a necessary trade‐off, the remaining 5 diffusion barriers, which include exchange terrace self‐diffusion, dimer formation, or the step‐down diffusion process on Mg(0001), show larger deviations. The trained ReaxFF force field describes all hopping terrace self‐diffusion processes within 0.1 eV accuracy but struggles to describe the corresponding exchange processes (▵ |E  a  | ≥0.3 eV). In an exchange process, the diffusing atom takes the place of a surface atom, which in turn is pushed to its destination. However, since these processes have much higher barriers than the hopping processes, they are of less importance for an accurate description of surface mobility. In general, terrace self‐diffusion on Mg(0001) (Figure 0)A (Figure 1 ‾ [38]  1) (Figure 1 ‾ Overview and schematic representation of trained terrace self‐diffusion processes on a) Mg(0001), b) Mg(10 0)A, and c) Mg(10 1 ‾ 1).

The vacancy energy calculated with the force field equals −6.82 eV and deviates very slightly from the DFT reference (−6.71 eV). The lattice constants and bulk moduli were only indirectly included in the force field training via the volume‐energy data points. In particular, the lattice constants deviate from the DFT values by at most 0.02 Å for the rock salt, wurtzite, zincblende, and hcp structures. The bulk modulus for the energetically favored rock salt structure is best described with less than 2 % error, while the other structures (wurtzite, zincblende, hcp) deviate around 5 % to 12 %. The cesium chloride structure, which is energetically unfavorable at ambient conditions, shows the largest deviation from the DFT reference data but constitutes the only experimentally confirmed structure, along with the rock salt phase. [43]  Surface energy results γ were trained only for the stoichiometric surfaces MgO(100) and Mg(110), since it is difficult to calculate the surface energy for the non‐stoichiometric surface MgO(111) (cf.

Wiley‐VCH GmbH According to DFT, the tetrahedral position tet‐1 between the first and second surface layer is the most stable adsorption site on Mg(0001), which is in agreement with the results of Francis and Taylor. [49]  vs . −7.69 eV [49]  2 molecule. In agreement with Francis and Taylor, we find that hcp adsorption sites are unstable in DFT; an atom placed there relaxes, in the case of Mg(0001), to the tet‐1 position. With the trained ReaxFF force field, the hcp sites are stable but, similar to fcc sites, the corresponding adsorption energy is less exothermic compared to the tet‐1 site with −4.02 eV and −4.01 eV for Mg(0001), respectively. A potential reason for the decreased adsorption energy could be the smaller coordination number. While four magnesium atoms surround the oxygen atom for the tetrahedral (tet) positions, there are only three surrounding atoms present for the fcc and hcp sites. The tet‐3 site on Mg(0001) was identified as a meta‐stable position with an energy of −3.79 eV in DFT but is calculated to be unstable with the force field. The most stable adsorption positions calculated with the force field are octahedral (oct) sites coordinated by six Mg atoms with −4.64 eV on Mg(0001), −4.69 eV on Mg(10 0)A, and −4.62 eV on Mg(10 1 ‾ 1), while DFT predicts this site to be less stable compared to tet sites. During training, it became clear that a trade‐off would be required between the accurate description of the relative stability sequences of the adsorption sites and that of the bulk phases. If we assigned a higher weight to the adsorption energy values, the Mg−O−Mg equilibrium angle changed in tandem, which in the most extreme case caused the wurtzite structure to be more stable than the rock salt phase. We ultimately decided to constrain the Mg−O−Mg equilibrium angle at 180°, thereby placing more weight on the accurate reproduction of the bulk phases. 1 ‾ Furthermore, we trained the thermodynamic stability of subsurface (sub) adsorption positions between the second and third surface layers on Mg(0001). While in DFT, the tet positions in deeper surface layers become thermodynamically less stable (−4.26 eV/−4.28 eV vs . −4.42 eV/−4.30 eV), the opposite trend is calculated with the force field (−4.44 eV/−4.45 eV vs . −4.36 eV/−4.33 eV). With the force field, the sub‐oct position shows nearly the same adsorption energy (−4.66 eV) compared to an adsorption site just below the surface (−4.64 eV). In the DFT reference data, the site further away from the surface is more stable (−4.05 eV vs . −3.92 eV). In summary, DFT calculations suggest that on Mg(0001), the adsorption sites in between the first and second surface layers are the most stable. With the trained force field, diffusion to deeper layers is calculated to be more favorable from a thermodynamic point of view. Finally, the activation barriers calculated using Equation (8) for the diffusion process between the oct adsorption site and its subsurface equivalent sub‐oct on Mg(0001) were part of the training set (Figure 0)A, and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) to validate the obtained parameters, which were not part of the training set. The performance of these diffusion processes is discussed in the Supporting Information (Figures S7, S8, and S9; Tables S3, S4, and S5. 1 ‾ Comparison of the diffusion pathway from the oct to the subsurface oct site on Mg(0001) calculated with DFT and ReaxFF. Grand‐canonical Monte Carlo simulations of the oxidation of a magnesium nanoparticle As initial test cases we applied the trained Mg/O potential in two subsequent GCMC simulations to investigate the thermodynamic oxidation behavior of a Mg nanoparticle. Therefore, we started with a clean, equilibrium‐shaped Mg 978 nanoparticle and inserted in the first GCMC simulation oxygen atoms up to an O/Mg ratio of 1.0. As shown in Figure 2 molecules is adsorbed on the surface. As the simulation continues, the surface is covered with more and more O 2 molecules but complete oxidation to the core was not achieved even after 10 000 iterations (see Figure S10). Thus, to accelerate the process, we decided to perform a second GCMC simulation, using a nanoparticle with an O/Mg ratio of 1.0 as the input structure from the first GCMC simulation. In 20 000 additional iterations, we allowed only O‐move steps but prohibited further oxygen atoms from being inserted or removed. As a result, now oxygen diffusion processes lead to oxidation of the particle's core. The final structure contains many patterns of the rock salt structure, which spread out in different spatial directions. Furthermore, grain boundaries are formed that make the particle appear amorphous. In summary, we show that a magnesium particle generated from Wulff construction oxidizes first at the surface oct sites from a thermodynamic point of view. Further oxygen adsorption is also thermodynamically favored despite the formed surface oxide layers. The fully oxidized particle exhibits an amorphous structure with rock salt structure elements but many grain boundaries. Grand‐canonical Monte Carlo simulation showing the oxidation of an equilibrium‐shaped Mg 978 nanoparticle at 300 K and 0.21 atm first up to and then at an O/Mg ratio of 1.0. Oxidation first occurs on the surface oct sites and subsequently penetrates the particle's core. Molecular dynamics simulation of the recrystallization of a magnesium oxide nanoparticle We subsequently carried out an MD simulation to recrystallize the particle obtained from the GCMC simulations. To this end, we performed a simulated thermal annealing procedure where we first heated the particle to 2000 K at a rate of 80 K ps −1 , maintained the temperature for 75 ps, and then slowly cooled the system down to 1 K at a rate of 16 K ps −1 , as shown in Figure  NVT simulation showing the recrystallization of an amorphous Mg nanoparticle into the rock salt structure by simulated thermal annealing at 2000 K. Molecular dynamics simulation of the passivation of the magnesium anode Contact of the Mg anode with oxygen impurities, traces of water, or decomposition products of the electrolyte results in an interface layer impermeable to Mg cations, leading to battery failure. [9]  0)A, and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) surfaces in contact with an oxygen atmosphere. A weakly coupled Nosé‐Hoover (NHC) thermostat set to 300 K was applied only to the ten innermost layers of the Mg slab to avoid quenching of surface reactions and to prevent surface melting which would otherwise have to be compensated by adding an inefficiently large number of surface layers. For Mg(0001), the energy evolution, average temperature in the simulation box, and snapshots at distinct time points are shown in Figure 1 ‾ 0)A and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) are presented in the Supporting Information (Figures S11 and S12). Since the average temperature inside the cell is insufficient to understand the processes taking place at the surface, we divided the 1 ‾ z ‐axis into 500 equally sized sections and calculated the temperature of all atoms inside the corresponding box. In this way, we obtained a temperature profile along the z ‐axis to calculate the surface temperature T  surf . This compartmentalization also allowed us to analyze the individual temperature profiles of the oxygen atmosphere, the Mg/O interface, and bulk magnesium (Figures S14, S15, and S16).  NVT simulation of the oxidation behavior of Mg(0001) at 300 K and an O 2 partial pressure 10 atm. Upon contact of the first O 2 molecules, the surface heats to several 1000 K. The high temperature fosters the formation of a rock salt interphase structure on top of the Mg anode. The maximum surface temperature T  surf,max was determined from the temperature profiles in Figure S14. The first oxygen molecules hitting the metal surface instantaneously dissociate and heat the surface to several 1000 K within the first 0.1 ns. On Mg(0001), the high temperature causes short‐term detachment of individual MgO clusters, which later readsorb on the surface. In addition, the elevated temperature causes high mobility at the interface, leading to surface recrystallization into the rock salt structure. However, the structures observed in this simulation are significantly more disordered compared to the recrystallized MgO particle (Figure T  surf,max =985 K remains significantly higher than in the bulk phase of the cell (Figure S14). At about 0.75 ns, equilibrium is reached, and MgO formation at the interface is complete, as underlined by molecular composition analysis (Figure S13). The number of intact O 2 molecules in the atmosphere or adsorbed on the surface remains constant, which is also true for O‐atoms bound in the MgO boundary phase. Similar trends as for Mg(0001) are also observed in simulations with Mg(10 0)A and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) surfaces in contact with oxygen; in fact, we found these surfaces to be even more reactive. The relative energy decreases the most for Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)A surface model and the oxidation penetrates the deepest, likely due to the more open surface structure. Over the course of oxidation, the average temperature reaches the highest values for Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)A and remains on a plateau for the longest time before decreasing again (Figure S15). Similarly, molecular composition analysis in Figure S13 shows that on Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)A, most O 1 ‾ 2 molecules were decomposed and bound in the MgO phase, followed by Mg(10 1) and finally Mg(0001) (Figure S13). This trend aligns with the relative surface energies, where Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)A and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) surfaces are less stable than Mg(0001) (see Table 1 ‾ Fournier et al. experimentally studied the oxidation of magnesium by exposing Mg to a pure oxygen atmosphere at 20 kPa and determined an MgO layer thickness of 260 Å at 300 K (170 Å at 150 K) for a 15 min exposure time. [29]  2 with the Mg surface. The thickness of the MgO resulting from our simulations constitute about one‐tenth of the overall surface thickness (Mg(0001) ≈ 20 Å, Mg(10 0)A 1 ‾ ≈ 25 Å, Mg(10 1) 1 ‾ ≈ 21 Å). Larger oxide layer thickness could likely be observed by using significantly more surface layers, and by turning off the thermostat which dampens oxygen mobility increasingly the deeper that oxygen atoms penetrate into the slab. Fournier et al. also suggested that the surface oxide growth at 300 K follows an inverse logarithmic law. This is consistent with our observations that after initial contact, the surface is heated to such an extent that oxidation to deeper layers is facilitated. However, once the first oxide layer is formed and the surface temperature has normalized, diffusion of oxygen bound in the MgO interphase into deeper surface layers is likely the rate‐determining step.

Magnesium‐magnesium interactions The first milestone of ReaxFF parameter training for the Mg/Mg metal interactions was to reproduce the bulk properties of Mg. Therefore, lattice constants, cohesive energies [(Eq. (3)], and bulk moduli of the crystal phases hexagonal close‐packed (hcp), face centered cubic (fcc), body centered cubic (bcc), β ‐tungsten type (a15), and simple cubic (sc) were introduced to the training set. Figure a  0 / c  0 ) of the lattice constants a  0 and c  0 in the hcp unit cell always corresponds with (8 / 3) 1 to the ideal value of a closed‐packed crystal, and second, the hcp and fcc cohesive energy will be identical. / 2 [37]  Equations of state (EOS) for bulk Mg crystal phases calculated with a) the trained ReaxFF force field and b) DFT.

The cohesive energy, in particular, is an important measure to describe bond strengths, and was therefore weighted more strongly during the training process; it varies at most by 0.01 eV for all crystal phases. This is also reflected in the relative stability between the crystal phases, which are in good agreement. ReaxFF slightly overestimates the bulk modulus for all crystal phases. This behavior is illustrated in the equation of state (EOS) curves presented in Figure In addition, we trained surface energies of the low index surfaces Mg(0001), Mg(10 0)A, Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)B, Mg(10 1 ‾ 1), Mg(10 1 ‾ 0), and Mg(10 2 ‾ 1), which were calculated using Equation (6).

Wiley‐VCH GmbH To obtain a smooth potential energy surface (PES), which is key to performing meaningful MD simulations, we added activation energies of selected self‐diffusion processes to the training set, calculated using Equation (8). Our goal was to introduce a diverse spectrum of different magnesium conformations but also of transition states into the training set. For the latter, we included terrace self‐diffusion barriers on Mg(0001), Mg(10 0)A, and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) (Figure 1 ‾ [42]  1)). To keep this section compact, we discuss only the performance of the terrace self‐diffusion barriers in the main text but refer to the Supporting Information for the additional diffusion processes (Figure S4, Table S1 for Mg(0001); Figure S5, Table S2 for Mg(10 1 ‾ 1)). Overall, the trained force field reproduces the reference DFT activation energies of 32 of the 37 processes to an accuracy of 1 ‾ | ▵ E  a  | ≤0.2 eV. As a necessary trade‐off, the remaining 5 diffusion barriers, which include exchange terrace self‐diffusion, dimer formation, or the step‐down diffusion process on Mg(0001), show larger deviations. The trained ReaxFF force field describes all hopping terrace self‐diffusion processes within 0.1 eV accuracy but struggles to describe the corresponding exchange processes (▵ |E  a  | ≥0.3 eV). In an exchange process, the diffusing atom takes the place of a surface atom, which in turn is pushed to its destination. However, since these processes have much higher barriers than the hopping processes, they are of less importance for an accurate description of surface mobility. In general, terrace self‐diffusion on Mg(0001) (Figure 0)A (Figure 1 ‾ [38]  1) (Figure 1 ‾ Overview and schematic representation of trained terrace self‐diffusion processes on a) Mg(0001), b) Mg(10 0)A, and c) Mg(10 1 ‾ 1).

Magnesium‐oxygen interactions Our training focuses on introducing EOS curves for the MgO crystal phases rock salt, wurtzite, zincblende, cesium chloride, and hcp to the training set for the Mg/O interactions. This selection of structures represents different coordination environments, bond distances, and geometries to provide a broad overview of the configurational space. Each EOS was constructed from eleven data points. The rock salt structure was weighted most strongly during training as this represents the preferred structure of MgO at ambient conditions.

The vacancy energy calculated with the force field equals −6.82 eV and deviates very slightly from the DFT reference (−6.71 eV). The lattice constants and bulk moduli were only indirectly included in the force field training via the volume‐energy data points. In particular, the lattice constants deviate from the DFT values by at most 0.02 Å for the rock salt, wurtzite, zincblende, and hcp structures. The bulk modulus for the energetically favored rock salt structure is best described with less than 2 % error, while the other structures (wurtzite, zincblende, hcp) deviate around 5 % to 12 %. The cesium chloride structure, which is energetically unfavorable at ambient conditions, shows the largest deviation from the DFT reference data but constitutes the only experimentally confirmed structure, along with the rock salt phase.

Wiley‐VCH GmbH According to DFT, the tetrahedral position tet‐1 between the first and second surface layer is the most stable adsorption site on Mg(0001), which is in agreement with the results of Francis and Taylor. [49]  vs . −7.69 eV [49]  2 molecule. In agreement with Francis and Taylor, we find that hcp adsorption sites are unstable in DFT; an atom placed there relaxes, in the case of Mg(0001), to the tet‐1 position. With the trained ReaxFF force field, the hcp sites are stable but, similar to fcc sites, the corresponding adsorption energy is less exothermic compared to the tet‐1 site with −4.02 eV and −4.01 eV for Mg(0001), respectively. A potential reason for the decreased adsorption energy could be the smaller coordination number. While four magnesium atoms surround the oxygen atom for the tetrahedral (tet) positions, there are only three surrounding atoms present for the fcc and hcp sites. The tet‐3 site on Mg(0001) was identified as a meta‐stable position with an energy of −3.79 eV in DFT but is calculated to be unstable with the force field. The most stable adsorption positions calculated with the force field are octahedral (oct) sites coordinated by six Mg atoms with −4.64 eV on Mg(0001), −4.69 eV on Mg(10 0)A, and −4.62 eV on Mg(10 1 ‾ 1), while DFT predicts this site to be less stable compared to tet sites. During training, it became clear that a trade‐off would be required between the accurate description of the relative stability sequences of the adsorption sites and that of the bulk phases. If we assigned a higher weight to the adsorption energy values, the Mg−O−Mg equilibrium angle changed in tandem, which in the most extreme case caused the wurtzite structure to be more stable than the rock salt phase. We ultimately decided to constrain the Mg−O−Mg equilibrium angle at 180°, thereby placing more weight on the accurate reproduction of the bulk phases. 1 ‾ Furthermore, we trained the thermodynamic stability of subsurface (sub) adsorption positions between the second and third surface layers on Mg(0001). While in DFT, the tet positions in deeper surface layers become thermodynamically less stable (−4.26 eV/−4.28 eV vs . −4.42 eV/−4.30 eV), the opposite trend is calculated with the force field (−4.44 eV/−4.45 eV vs . −4.36 eV/−4.33 eV). With the force field, the sub‐oct position shows nearly the same adsorption energy (−4.66 eV) compared to an adsorption site just below the surface (−4.64 eV). In the DFT reference data, the site further away from the surface is more stable (−4.05 eV vs . −3.92 eV). In summary, DFT calculations suggest that on Mg(0001), the adsorption sites in between the first and second surface layers are the most stable. With the trained force field, diffusion to deeper layers is calculated to be more favorable from a thermodynamic point of view. Finally, the activation barriers calculated using Equation (8) for the diffusion process between the oct adsorption site and its subsurface equivalent sub‐oct on Mg(0001) were part of the training set (Figure 0)A, and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) to validate the obtained parameters, which were not part of the training set. The performance of these diffusion processes is discussed in the Supporting Information (Figures S7, S8, and S9; Tables S3, S4, and S5. 1 ‾ Comparison of the diffusion pathway from the oct to the subsurface oct site on Mg(0001) calculated with DFT and ReaxFF.

Grand‐canonical Monte Carlo simulations of the oxidation of a magnesium nanoparticle As initial test cases we applied the trained Mg/O potential in two subsequent GCMC simulations to investigate the thermodynamic oxidation behavior of a Mg nanoparticle. Therefore, we started with a clean, equilibrium‐shaped Mg 978 nanoparticle and inserted in the first GCMC simulation oxygen atoms up to an O/Mg ratio of 1.0. As shown in Figure 2 molecules is adsorbed on the surface. As the simulation continues, the surface is covered with more and more O 2 molecules but complete oxidation to the core was not achieved even after 10 000 iterations (see Figure S10). Thus, to accelerate the process, we decided to perform a second GCMC simulation, using a nanoparticle with an O/Mg ratio of 1.0 as the input structure from the first GCMC simulation. In 20 000 additional iterations, we allowed only O‐move steps but prohibited further oxygen atoms from being inserted or removed. As a result, now oxygen diffusion processes lead to oxidation of the particle's core. The final structure contains many patterns of the rock salt structure, which spread out in different spatial directions. Furthermore, grain boundaries are formed that make the particle appear amorphous. In summary, we show that a magnesium particle generated from Wulff construction oxidizes first at the surface oct sites from a thermodynamic point of view. Further oxygen adsorption is also thermodynamically favored despite the formed surface oxide layers. The fully oxidized particle exhibits an amorphous structure with rock salt structure elements but many grain boundaries.

Oxidation first occurs on the surface oct sites and subsequently penetrates the particle's core.

Molecular dynamics simulation of the recrystallization of a magnesium oxide nanoparticle We subsequently carried out an MD simulation to recrystallize the particle obtained from the GCMC simulations. To this end, we performed a simulated thermal annealing procedure where we first heated the particle to 2000 K at a rate of 80 K ps −1 , maintained the temperature for 75 ps, and then slowly cooled the system down to 1 K at a rate of 16 K ps −1 , as shown in Figure  NVT simulation showing the recrystallization of an amorphous Mg nanoparticle into the rock salt structure by simulated thermal annealing at 2000 K.

Molecular dynamics simulation of the passivation of the magnesium anode Contact of the Mg anode with oxygen impurities, traces of water, or decomposition products of the electrolyte results in an interface layer impermeable to Mg cations, leading to battery failure. [9]  0)A, and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) surfaces in contact with an oxygen atmosphere. A weakly coupled Nosé‐Hoover (NHC) thermostat set to 300 K was applied only to the ten innermost layers of the Mg slab to avoid quenching of surface reactions and to prevent surface melting which would otherwise have to be compensated by adding an inefficiently large number of surface layers. For Mg(0001), the energy evolution, average temperature in the simulation box, and snapshots at distinct time points are shown in Figure 1 ‾ 0)A and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) are presented in the Supporting Information (Figures S11 and S12). Since the average temperature inside the cell is insufficient to understand the processes taking place at the surface, we divided the 1 ‾ z ‐axis into 500 equally sized sections and calculated the temperature of all atoms inside the corresponding box. In this way, we obtained a temperature profile along the z ‐axis to calculate the surface temperature T  surf . This compartmentalization also allowed us to analyze the individual temperature profiles of the oxygen atmosphere, the Mg/O interface, and bulk magnesium (Figures S14, S15, and S16).  NVT simulation of the oxidation behavior of Mg(0001) at 300 K and an O 2 partial pressure 10 atm. Upon contact of the first O 2 molecules, the surface heats to several 1000 K. The high temperature fosters the formation of a rock salt interphase structure on top of the Mg anode. The maximum surface temperature T  surf,max was determined from the temperature profiles in Figure S14. The first oxygen molecules hitting the metal surface instantaneously dissociate and heat the surface to several 1000 K within the first 0.1 ns. On Mg(0001), the high temperature causes short‐term detachment of individual MgO clusters, which later readsorb on the surface. In addition, the elevated temperature causes high mobility at the interface, leading to surface recrystallization into the rock salt structure. However, the structures observed in this simulation are significantly more disordered compared to the recrystallized MgO particle (Figure T  surf,max =985 K remains significantly higher than in the bulk phase of the cell (Figure S14). At about 0.75 ns, equilibrium is reached, and MgO formation at the interface is complete, as underlined by molecular composition analysis (Figure S13). The number of intact O 2 molecules in the atmosphere or adsorbed on the surface remains constant, which is also true for O‐atoms bound in the MgO boundary phase. Similar trends as for Mg(0001) are also observed in simulations with Mg(10 0)A and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) surfaces in contact with oxygen; in fact, we found these surfaces to be even more reactive. The relative energy decreases the most for Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)A surface model and the oxidation penetrates the deepest, likely due to the more open surface structure. Over the course of oxidation, the average temperature reaches the highest values for Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)A and remains on a plateau for the longest time before decreasing again (Figure S15). Similarly, molecular composition analysis in Figure S13 shows that on Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)A, most O 1 ‾ 2 molecules were decomposed and bound in the MgO phase, followed by Mg(10 1) and finally Mg(0001) (Figure S13). This trend aligns with the relative surface energies, where Mg(10 1 ‾ 0)A and Mg(10 1 ‾ 1) surfaces are less stable than Mg(0001) (see Table 1 ‾ Fournier et al. experimentally studied the oxidation of magnesium by exposing Mg to a pure oxygen atmosphere at 20 kPa and determined an MgO layer thickness of 260 Å at 300 K (170 Å at 150 K) for a 15 min exposure time. [29]  2 with the Mg surface. The thickness of the MgO resulting from our simulations constitute about one‐tenth of the overall surface thickness (Mg(0001) ≈ 20 Å, Mg(10 0)A 1 ‾ ≈ 25 Å, Mg(10 1) 1 ‾ ≈ 21 Å). Larger oxide layer thickness could likely be observed by using significantly more surface layers, and by turning off the thermostat which dampens oxygen mobility increasingly the deeper that oxygen atoms penetrate into the slab. Fournier et al. also suggested that the surface oxide growth at 300 K follows an inverse logarithmic law. This is consistent with our observations that after initial contact, the surface is heated to such an extent that oxidation to deeper layers is facilitated. However, once the first oxide layer is formed and the surface temperature has normalized, diffusion of oxygen bound in the MgO interphase into deeper surface layers is likely the rate‐determining step. [32] 

Conclusion In this work, we developed a reactive force field description for Mg/O systems for the ReaxFF framework. Magnesium‐magnesium interactions were obtained using the KVIK optimization routine designed explicitly for metallic systems, while magnesium‐oxygen interactions were trained using the successive one‐parameter parabolic interpolation (SOPPI) optimizer. As a result, the force field can reliably reproduce the bulk, surface, adsorption, and diffusion properties of both metallic Mg and the MgO salt. We first showed in a GCMC simulation that, from a thermodynamic point of view, a Mg nanoparticle (here 978 atoms) is first oxidized at surface oct sites. The structure obtained at the end of the simulation is mostly amorphous with individual domains showing rock salt ordering, separated by grain boundaries. For complete transformation to the rock salt structure, the particle must be heated to 2000 K in an MD simulation for at least 75 ps. If the thermal annealing is performed at too low temperatures or the system is cooled down too quickly, grain boundaries remain visible. We further showed the effects of oxygen impurities on Mg surfaces. We demonstrated that O 2 immediately dissociates upon first contact with the Mg surface, heating the surface to several 1000 K. The high temperature catalyzes further oxidation and causes the formation of rock salt phases separated by grain boundaries. Among the Mg surfaces, Mg(1010)A is the most reactive, forming an MgO layer with a thickness of up to 25 Å. The future goal is to extend the presented force field by Mg/H and Mg/C parameters to obtain a full magnesium electrolyte description to model the initial steps of SEI formation in Mg batteries. For the moment, our trained force field offers the opportunity to study the passivation and oxidation of metallic Mg in more detail or to investigate the ongoing reactions in Mg‐air batteries.[ 50  51  52 

Computational Details The ReaxFF reactive force field method ReaxFF is a reactive force field method introduced by van Duin et al. that can model bond breakages and formations without explicitly describing the system's electronic structure.[ 53  54  BO , which is further divided into σ ( ij  ), π ( B O i j σ ), and ππ ( B O i j π ) bond contributions [Eq. (1)]. The continuity of the function provides constant differentiability of the energy landscape, which is necessary to calculate the forces acting on the atoms. Thus, ReaxFF enables to accurately describe bond transitions and long‐distance covalent interactions which are necessary to account for transition states and reaction barriers. B O i j π π [55]     B O i j = B O i j σ + B O i j π + B O i j π π = e x p p b o 1 r i j r 0 σ p b o 2 + e x p p b o 3 r i j r 0 π p b o 4 + e x p p b o 5 r i j r 0 π π p b o 6 where BO is the total bond‐order between two atoms ij  i and j , r is the inter‐atomic distance, ij  r  0 are the equilibrium bond distances of the bonds, and σ , π , a n d π π p  bo1 to p  bo6 are empirical parameters. Thereupon, the system's total energy E  system is calculated using Equation (2), which is composed of several bond‐order dependent energy terms like the binding energy E  bond , three‐body angular E  angle and four‐body torsional energy E  tors , and penalty energy terms for over E  over and under coordination E  under . Non‐bond‐order dependent energy terms are the electrostatic Coulomb energy E  Coulomb and the dispersive van der Waals interactions E  vdWaals :    E system = E bond + E angle + E tors + E over + E under + E vdWaals + E Coulomb + E specific The last energy term E  specific summarizes energy contributions that were not relevant to our force field, such as hydrogen bonding or the energy correction in conjugated systems. For a detailed description of the energy terms, we refer to the Supporting Information in the work of Chenoweth et al. [54]  [56]  [53]  ReaxFF force field training The training set for the Mg/Mg and Mg/O parameters was entirely composed of quantum chemical calculations. The Mg/Mg parameters were trained against data from our previous publication, [38]  [27]  KVIK optimization routine, which was developed in particular for fast and accurate training of metal ReaxFF force fields. [22]  [57] The Mg/O parameters, on the other hand, were trained with the classical successive one‐parameter parabolic interpolation (SOPPI). [58]  [59]  The cohesive energies E  coh for the following Mg crystal phases hcp, fcc, bcc, a15, and sc were calculated by Equation    E c o h = - 1 N E M g b u l k - N · E M g a t o m where is the energy of the Mg bulk crystal structure, E M g b u l k is the energy of an isolated Mg atom and E M g a t o m N is the amount of Mg atoms in the corresponding bulk unit cell. In contrast, the heats of formation ▵ f  H for the MgO crystal phases rock salt, wurtzite, zincblende, cesium chloride, and hcp were obtained as follows:    Δ f H = 1 N E M g O b u l k - N · E M g , h c p b u l k - N 2 E O 2 g a s - E O 2 Z P E where is the bulk energy of the MgO crystal phase, E M g O b u l k is the bulk energy of hcp Mg per Mg atom, E M g , h c p b u l k is the gas‐phase energy of one oxygen molecule, E O 2 g a s is the vibrational zero point energy within the harmonic normal approximation, and E O 2 Z P E N is the amount of MgO fragments within the MgO crystal phase. The bulk modulus was obtained with the jellium equation of state[ 60  61  E  v was calculated in a (2 × 2 × 2) MgO rock salt unit cell with the following equation:    E v = E M g O 32 b u l k - E M g 32 O 31 b u l k - E O 2 g a s 2 where is the bulk energy of the rock salt structure, E M g O 32 b u l k is the bulk energy of the rock salt structure with one missing oxygen atom and E M g 32 O 31 b u l k is the gas‐phase energy of one oxygen molecule. E O 2 g a s The surface energy γ was determined as shown below:    γ = 1 2 A E s l a b - N · E b u l k where E  slab is the energy of the surface slab, E  bulk is the bulk energy per Mg atom/MgO fragment, N is the amount of Mg atoms/MgO fragments in the slab, and A is the surface slab area. The area A has to be multiplied by two because of the symmetric slab configuration. The Wulff construction [40]  [41]  The adsorption energies E  ad were calculated by subtracting the energy of the slab E  slab and the adsorbate E  adsorbate from the energy of the relaxed structure E  tot containing the slab and the adsorbate. For a magnesium adsorbate, E  adsorbate equaled the energy of an isolated Mg atom E  atom and for an oxygen adsorbate E  adsorbate corresponded to half of the energy of an O 2 molecule : E O 2 g a s 2    E ad = E tot - E slab - E adsorbate The activation energy equaled the energy difference between a stable adsorption position E a f o r / r e v E  IS and the transition state energy / FS E  TS of a diffusion process from (forward or to (reverse) this position:    E a f o r / r e v = E T S - E I S / F S DFT calculations All first principles calculations to obtain the training set for the parameterization of the Mg/O parameters were performed with the periodic plane‐wave DFT code Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).[ 62  63  s and O 2 s 4 p electrons were considered as valence electrons.[ 64  65  [66]  k ‐points sampling using a gamma‐centered mesh (due to the hexagonal symmetry of hcp Mg) with a minimum grid density of 0.14 Å −1 (Figure S1b). We also ensured that the number of k ‐points in one direction was always rounded up to the next odd integer. To provide consistency with the Mg/Mg training set, we used Gaussian smearing with a width of 0.1 eV for the one‐electron states as we did for metallic magnesium. [38]  × 10 −5 eV between two consecutive minimization cycles, and the norms of all forces had to be less than 1 × 10 −3 eV Å −1 . Surface energy results were calculated using (1 × 1) cells with a minimum thickness of 20 Å and an equally large vacuum region. Oxygen adsorption energy results and diffusion barriers were calculated on (4 × 4) Mg(0001), (4 × 2) Mg(10 0)A, and (4 1 ‾ × 2) Mg(10 1) periodic surface models with six surface layers where the coordinates of the lowest two layers were constrained to simulate bulk behavior. To find the transition state, we applied the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI‐NEB) method as implemented in the transition state tools for VASP (VTST) package.[ 1 ‾ 67  68  −2 . We used the image‐dependent pair potential (IDPP) as the initial estimate for the MEP to achieve faster convergence.[ 69  70  × 10 −8 eV and 1 × 10 −8 eV Å −1 , respectively.

The coordinates for the insertion and displacement steps are chosen randomly. The algorithm places atoms further than 1.85 Å to the nearest atom to prevent a Coulomb collapse (excessive Coulomb attraction) but closer than 3.0 Å to achieve faster convergence. Subsequently, the system's geometry is relaxed until the norms of all forces were less than 0.1 eV Å −1 or the maximum number of steps (1000) was reached.

We performed the recrystallization of the MgO particle in an NVT ensemble using a NHC thermostat with a time constant τ of 100 fs. The initial geometry corresponded to the MgO particle obtained by the GCMC simulations, shown in the blue box in Figure × 16) Mg(0001), (16 × 8) Mg(10 0)A and (16 1 ‾ × 8) Mg(10 1) periodic surface model systems with 60 layers for 1 ns (≙4 000 000 iterations with 0.25 fs time step). On each side of the surface slab was a vacuum of 2000 Å thickness filled with 5504 O 1 ‾ 2 molecules whose atomic configurations were generated using the PACKMOL software. [76]  2 molecules using the ideal gas law at 300 K at ten times atmospheric pressure (10 atm). The initial velocities of all atoms followed a Maxwell‐Boltzmann distribution for 300 K. Furthermore, we applied a weakly coupled NHC thermostat ( τ =1000 fs) to the ten innermost Mg layers at 300 K to provide a heat sink for the reaction heat generated at the surface. The choice to use a heat sink region constitutes a compromise: in simulations without a thermostat, the Mg surface heated far beyond its melting temperature due to the strongly exothermic oxidation reaction taking place and evaporation was observed. The number of surface layers required to serve as a heat sink to compensate for this effect is computationally inefficient. In contrast, applying the thermostat to all atoms quenches the surface reactions altogether. With the thermostat layer used here, the surface heats up to several 1000 K for a short time upon first contact of the bare Mg surface with oxygen but the surface remains intact. An illustration of the cell setup and the simulation settings used are given in Figure S2.

Furthermore, we applied a weakly coupled NHC thermostat ( τ =1000 fs) to the ten innermost Mg layers at 300 K to provide a heat sink for the reaction heat generated at the surface. The choice to use a heat sink region constitutes a compromise: in simulations without a thermostat, the Mg surface heated far beyond its melting temperature due to the strongly exothermic oxidation reaction taking place and evaporation was observed. The number of surface layers required to serve as a heat sink to compensate for this effect is computationally inefficient. In contrast, applying the thermostat to all atoms quenches the surface reactions altogether. With the thermostat layer used here, the surface heats up to several 1000 K for a short time upon first contact of the bare Mg surface with oxygen but the surface remains intact. An illustration of the cell setup and the simulation settings used are given in Figure S2.

10.1002_ece3.3985,"Abstract Polyandry, where multiple mating by females results in the temporal and spatial overlap of ejaculates from two or more males, is taxonomically widespread and occurs in varying frequencies within and among species. In decapods (crabs, lobsters, crayfish, and prawns), rates of polyandry are likely to be variable, but the extent to which patterns of multiple paternity reflect multiple mating, and thus are shaped by postmating processes that bias fertilization toward one or a subset of mated males, is unclear. Here, we use microsatellite markers to examine the frequency of multiple mating (the presence of spermatophores from two or more males) and patterns of paternity in wild populations of western rock lobster ( Panulirus cygnus ). Our data confirm that >45% of females had attached spermatophores arising from at least two males (i.e., confirming polyandry), but we found very limited evidence for multiple paternity; among 24 clutches sampled in this study, only two arose from fertilizations by two or more males. Single inferred paternal genotypes accounted for all remaining progeny genotypes in each clutch, including several instances when the mother had been shown to mate with two or more males. These findings highlight the need for further work to understand whether polyandry is adaptive and to uncover the mechanisms underlying postmating paternity biases in this system.","INTRODUCTION Polyandry, where females mate with two or more males, is taxonomically widespread (Birkhead & Møller, A common assumption in the literature in sexual selection is that polyandry will inevitably lead to multiple paternity. Indeed, multiple paternity, as estimated by assigning parentage of offspring from putatively multiply mated females, is commonly used to estimate the level of polyandry in natural populations (Taylor, Price, & Wedell, The mating systems of decapod crustaceans are highly diverse and complex (Duffy & Thiel, Parentage studies have revealed that polyandry is widespread in decapods and that there is substantial variation in the extent of multiple paternity within and among species, ranging from zero in the European lobster, Homarus gammarus (Ellis et al., Munida sarsi (Bailie, Hynes, & Prodohl, The western rock lobster ( Panulirus cygnus ) is endemic to the Indo‐West Pacific Ocean region (see Figure P. cygnus is described in detail elsewhere (Chittleborough, P. cygnus includes a long (~9–11 months) oceanic larval phase, during which planktonic phyllosoma larvae disperse as far as 1,500 km offshore. Helped by favorable winds and currents, the larvae subsequently return to the continental shelf where the final‐stage larvae metamorphose into the puerulus (postlarvae) that swim toward the shore and settle in shallow reefs. The settled pueruli develop into juveniles and subsequently adults in 5–6 years. The western rock lobster ( Panulirus cygnus ).

Loo et al. unpubl. data) found evidence of high levels of polyandry in natural populations, with up to 52% of mated females at some locations carrying spermatophores from two or more males. However, this previous study did not genotype fertilized eggs and therefore was unable to confirm whether multiple mating translated into multiple paternity. In this study, we use microsatellite markers to examine patterns of paternity in two wild populations of P. cygnus . By focusing on both singly and multiply mated females (i.e., females carrying spermatophores from one male or two or more males, respectively), we are able to test whether multiple mating leads to multiple paternity. In this way, our study combines data on multiple mating and offspring paternity to provide insights into the likely importance of postmating sexual selection in this system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling The study was conducted in Rottnest Island, located 18 km west of Fremantle, in south‐west Western Australia (32°00′S, 115°30′E). Sampling was conducted over 16 days in February 2015 by the West Australian Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development; Fisheries Division as part of their regular monitoring program. Lobsters were sampled at two locations (Figure Map showing the sampling sites at Rottnest Island. The areas shaded green represent marine protection zones For each lobster captured during these collections, the sex and carapace length (CL, measured to the nearest 0.1 mm using a dial caliper) were recorded.

Data analysis The program MICRO‐CHECKER (Van Oosterhout, Hutchinson, Wills, & Shipley, PI , the average probability of different random individuals sharing the same genotype by chance) and a more conservative estimate of PI , PIsibs , which takes into account the presence of relatives, were also calculated using GENALEX. The same software was used to estimate the number of alleles and observed and expected heterozygosity for each locus from the maternal genotypes. Deviations from random mating were characterized using the F  IS statistic (inbreeding coefficient). Positive and negative F  IS values indicate a deficit or excess of heterozygotes relative to random mating, respectively. Linkage disequilibrium between each pair of loci was evaluated by testing the significance of association between genotypes. Inbreeding coefficient estimates were performed using FSTAT version 2.9.3 software package (Goudet, Paternity was investigated by genotyping ~20 fertilized eggs obtained from each of the sampled females (see Table In addition to the paternity analysis, inferred paternal genotypes for each clutch were compared to the genotype of the spermatophore attached to the corresponding mother. Genotype matching was carried out using the genotype identity option in GENALEX.

Genotype matching was carried out using the genotype identity option in GENALEX.

RESULTS A total of 25 females carrying eggs (15 from Armstrong Bay and 10 from Kingston Reef) were genotyped. Based on genotype identity, one female from Kingston Reef was sampled twice. Of the remaining 24 females, 11 (~46%) had attached spermatophores with genotypes consisting of more than two alleles at a locus, indicating the presence of DNA from more than one male. (Note that we have previously confirmed that spermatophores consisting of multiple genotypes are unlikely to result from genotyping errors or contamination of female DNA and are therefore likely to result from multiple mating; J. Loo et al., unpubl. data.) A further five females had spermatophores with genotypes from a single male that did not match the genotype of the inferred sire, suggesting that these females had also mated with two or more males during the reproductive season. The maternal genotypes showed no evidence of null alleles, and there were no significant deviations from HWE at any locus ( p >  .05 in all cases). The probability of sampling identical maternal genotypes ( PI ) was 3.5 × 10 −7 , and a more conservative estimate of PI, which takes into account the presence of relatives, PIsibs, was 5.2 × 10 −3 . The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 26, with observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.042 to 0.917 (Table Genetic variation at microsatellite loci used in this study Locus  n   N  a   H  O   H  E   F  IS  Pcyg03 24 5 0.250 0.323 0.25 Pcyg04 24 26 0.917 0.953 0.06 Pcyg05 24 7 0.708 0.710 0.02 Pcyg11 23 8 0.826 0.733 −0.11 Pcyg15 24 2 0.375 0.430 0.15 Pcyg18 24 2 0.042 0.041 0.00 S28 24 9 0.625 0.641 0.05 W25 22 9 0.591 0.543 −0.06 Estimates are based on maternal genotypes pooled across locations. n , sample size; N  a , number of alleles; H  O , observed heterozygosity; H  E , expected heterozygosity; and F  IS inbreeding coefficient ( p > .05 for all). John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Based on initial inference, only one of 24 clutches showed multiple paternity. According to initial inference and GERUD, the minimum number of sires per clutch was one in 22 cases, with two cases of multiple paternity detected (minimum number of sires of two and three).

DISCUSSION Our study confirms that while multiple mating by female P. cygnus is relatively common, incidences of multiple paternity are extremely rare. We found that spermatophores attached to females often came from two or more males, confirming our previous evidence that polyandry is widespread in natural populations of P. cygnus (J. Loo et al., unpubl. data). Despite this evidence for female multiple mating, however, we found limited evidence of multiple paternity. One simple explanation for the disparity between patterns of female multiple mating and the incidence of multiple paternity is that our sampling protocol may have resulted in low statistical power. Recently, Veliz et al. ( n =  50 females yields very high statistical power to detect multiple paternity, even in highly fecund species with 1 × 10 6 eggs per clutch. In our study, we were restricted to approx. half this number of females, possibly restricting our ability to fully detect cases of multiple paternity. However, Veliz et al. ( A second possible explanation for the disparity between patterns of female multiple mating and the incidence of multiple paternity is that females mate consecutively with individual males each time they produce a batch of eggs, and that our observed patterns of (largely single) paternity reflect a pattern of serial monogamy over the course of the breeding season. As we note above, in P. cygnus mating entails the attachment of the male's spermatophore (tar spot) to the underside of the female, which is partially eroded by the female during fertilization and is only sloughed off in the following molting. Subsequent matings within the same reproductive season (molt cycle) involve a male depositing a fresh spermatophoric mass on top of the previously eroded (used) spermatophore (de Lestang & Melville‐Smith, A final explanation for the high levels of polyandry observed in this study is that females mate with multiple males between fertilization events and sperm competition and/or female cryptic choice function to refine fertilization success in favor of a subset of mated males. This explanation also accounts for the disparity between patterns of multiple mating (high incidence) and multiple paternity (low incidence). In species where females store spermatophores externally, sperm competition can occur when a male displaces or removes the spermatophore from the female. For example, in the freshwater crayfish Austropotamobius italicus , males remove and consume all (or most) of the spermatophores from previously mated males before releasing their own sperm (Galeotti et al., Idiosepius paradoxus ; Sato, Yoshida, & Kasugai, Symphodus ocellatus ; Alonzo, Stiver, & Marsh‐Rollo, R. typus (Thiel & Hinojosa, Panulirus guttatus (Magallon‐Gayon, Briones‐Fourzan, & Lozano‐Alvarez, P. cygnus , spermatophores are attached externally to the female and fertilization is temporally decoupled from mating, suggesting that there is some opportunity for cryptic female choice in this system. We clearly require further observational and/or experimental studies to identify the mechanisms that generate paternity biases in this system. In summary, this study revealed limited evidence of multiple paternity in P. cygnus , despite the high frequency of multiple mating. This suggests that although females mated with more than one male, fertilization was attained by only a subset (one or two) of these males. We have yet to determine whether female multiple mating is adaptive (e.g., because it enables females to ensure that sperm from intrinsically “good” males win the race to fertilize their eggs; Curtsinger,

10.1002_ece3.4466,"Abstract Sex determination in Australian agamid lizards shows a complex framework of different mechanisms, varying even among closely related taxa. It is clear that discrete classification of these species as either having genetic ( GSD ) or environmental sex determination ( ESD ) does not agree with empirical data. Although many species in this group show temperature‐dependent sex determination ( TSD ), recent evidence suggests additional genetic or epigenetic effects. A proposed model explaining the adaptive significance and evolution of TSD in short‐lived agamids predicts that selection will favor temperature‐biased sex ratios in species with intense male‐male competition. Here, we use experimental incubation at (near) constant temperatures to test whether the sex of Australian painted dragons ( Ctenophorus pictus ) is influenced by temperature, building on previous research yet to have reached an agreement regarding the role of temperature in this species. In this study, incubation temperature and parental identity affected hatchling sex suggesting that environment and genetics may work in concert to determine sex in this species. Although our results are consistent with TSD , our data cannot rule out a temperature‐by‐sex effect on egg or hatchling mortality. However, our findings together with the observed differences of sex determination systems in closely related species within this genus may provide novel opportunities to address fundamental questions in the evolution of sex determination systems.","INTRODUCTION The fundamental biological process of sex determination has been under intense scientific research for decades, mainly because of its profound implications on the phenotype of individuals and the formation of sex ratios in natural populations (West, Reece, & Sheldon, Sex allocation studies on birds and mammals are numerous (reviewed in Wapstra et al., Numerous models have been proposed to explain the evolution and adaptive significance of TSD (see reviews by Bull, The adaptive significance of TSD in short‐lived lizards has been suggested by Warner et al. ( Ctenophorus pictus ), may not be consistent at reassessment of these effects (Harlow, Here, we use Australian painted dragons to further examine the effect of incubation temperature on the sex of hatchlings, building on the work of Harlow ( C. pictus is in congruence with the traits listed by Warner et al.'s model, thus, predicting that this species has a temperature‐influenced sex determination system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Study species and husbandry The Australian painted dragon is a small (8–16 g, 65–95 mm snout‐vent length [SVL]) agamid lizard occurring in open sandy habitats and low vegetation, with a habitat range from central and western New South Wales to Western Australia. They are short‐lived (only about 10% living to a second hibernation), and males are highly territorial and compete for mating opportunities (Olsson, Schwartz, Uller, & Healey, Egg collection, incubation, and sexing of hatchlings Cages were checked daily for recently laid clutches. Females laid 1–4 clutches with an average of 1.63 ± 0.20 (mean ± SE , N =  19) clutches with an average 3.67 ± 0.27 (mean ± SE , N =  30) eggs per clutch. There were 19 first clutches (i.e. first clutch laid by a female), 8‐second clutches, three‐third clutches (Supporting information Table N =  110 from 19 females). The true proportion of fertilized eggs was, however, unknown. Prior to incubation, the eggs were cleaned from sand and moisture, weighed to the nearest 0.001 g, and placed individually in 125‐ml disposable plastic cups half‐buried in moist vermiculite (1:5 by volume, resulting approximately a −12 kPa water potential) filling a third of the cup. The cups were sealed using plastic cling wrap and a rubber band to prevent extensive moisture loss and placed in incubators set at constant 28, 30, and 32°C. Treatment temperatures were chosen based on the previously suggested ideal incubation temperature of 30°C (Olsson et al., SE ): 27.9 ± 0.002 ( N =  13,337), 29.9 ± 0.004 ( N =  10,055), and 31.8 ± 0.004 ( N =  15,453), respectively. Eggs from a single clutch were allocated equally across the three temperature treatments, in concordance with a split‐clutch design. To minimize the effect of possible thermal gradients inside the incubators, the cups were rotated among three shelves in each incubator every 2 weeks. Water was added to each cup during this rotation accounting for the small, but clear, loss of water through evaporation (about 1 g per week). Incubators were checked daily for hatchlings and dead eggs. The sex of hatchlings was determined by hemipenal transillumination in males (Brown,  Ctenophorus pictus hatchling hemipenes revealed by hemipenal transillumination Statistical analysis The effect of incubation temperature on sex was analyzed using sex (binary data) as the dependent variable, mean incubation temperature as fixed factor, and parental identity as random effect. Maternal and paternal identity could unfortunately not be separated as females were housed with the same male throughout the experiment. The model was fitted following a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approach using the PROC GLIMMIX macro in SAS v.9.4 with a binomial distribution and a logit link function (Littell, Milliken, Stroup, & Wolfinger, F test and the random effect using a likelihood ratio test.

Statistical analysis The effect of incubation temperature on sex was analyzed using sex (binary data) as the dependent variable, mean incubation temperature as fixed factor, and parental identity as random effect. Maternal and paternal identity could unfortunately not be separated as females were housed with the same male throughout the experiment.

DISCUSSION The research of reptiles has consistently shown that sex allocation cannot be explained with discrete sex determination systems (GSD or ESD) but requires a continuum between the two (Sarre et al., C. pictus , as predicted by the model proposed by Warner et al. ( Temperature effects Experimental work exploring the effect of temperature on sex allocation in C. pictus has, inconsistently, shown both the presence (present study; Harlow, C. pictus . The model expects that selection for TSD will be strongest in reptiles with: (a) a prolonged breeding season; (b) a short lifespan; (c) intense male‐male competition; and (d) little effect of hatching date (time of year) on the survival of juveniles. The three‐first factors are easily tested, and C. pictus possess all three. The fourth factor is more difficult to examine, and field data on short‐lived reptiles are limited. Hatching date was, however, found not to affect juvenile survival differently among the sexes in the Australian jacky dragon, Amphibolurus muricatus (Warner & Shine, If such variation of reproductive success occurs in C. pictus , seasonal timing of hatching could be the outcome of: (a) active female nest‐site choice, resulting in eggs being laid in different nest‐sites early versus late in the season; or (b) passive nest‐site choice, resulting in eggs being exposed to seasonal differences in nest temperatures. In the first scenario, maternal nest‐site choice could shift seasonally, selecting nests with a temperature that would produce the sex most favored to that time of the season. Although the presence of nest‐site choice in C. pictus has not yet been investigated, a close relative (Hugall, Foster, Hutchinson, & Lee, C. pictus experiences a seasonal increase in ambient temperatures during the breeding season, and in agreement with the model, the results showed that lower temperature (analogues to earlier in the season) produced a higher proportion of females. Although other studies on TSD in Ctenophorus spp. are relatively few, the genus seems to follow the “short‐lived agamid” model discussed above. Of the four species tested ( Ctenophorus decresii , Ctenophorus fordi , Ctenophorus ornatus and C. pictus ), all are short‐lived, have a prolonged breeding season, and male‐male competition over mating opportunities has been observed in all but C. fordi . In agreement with predictions, evidence for TSD has been found in all species but C. fordi (Harlow, A major limitation of this study is that we cannot rule out temperature‐by‐sex effects on mortality as an explanation for the observed differences in sex ratio among the tested incubation temperatures. This effect could be present during the egg stage leading to a greater mortality of one sex during embryogenesis and thus creating a false impression of TSD. An alternative explanation for the high proportion of unhatched eggs in this study is that they were never fertilized in the first place. In another study of the same species, they report on a hatching success consistently over 81% (Tobler, Healey, & Olsson, We found a significant temperature‐by‐sex effect on posthatching mortality (Supporting information Table Parental effects Parental effects on sex ratio has been found in C. pictus (present study; Uller et al., C. pictus offers interesting opportunities for further research. It is, however, more likely that the parental effect on sex ratio in this study is maternally derived, as previously shown by Uller et al. ( To date, research on C. pictus demonstrates an increasingly complex sex determination system, including effects of incubation temperature and possibly genetic and epigenetic factors (Harlow, Chelodina longicollis (Ezaz et al.,

In the first scenario, maternal nest‐site choice could shift seasonally, selecting nests with a temperature that would produce the sex most favored to that time of the season. Although the presence of nest‐site choice in C. pictus has not yet been investigated, a close relative (Hugall, Foster, Hutchinson, & Lee, C. pictus experiences a seasonal increase in ambient temperatures during the breeding season, and in agreement with the model, the results showed that lower temperature (analogues to earlier in the season) produced a higher proportion of females. Although other studies on TSD in Ctenophorus spp. are relatively few, the genus seems to follow the “short‐lived agamid” model discussed above. Of the four species tested ( Ctenophorus decresii , Ctenophorus fordi , Ctenophorus ornatus and C. pictus ), all are short‐lived, have a prolonged breeding season, and male‐male competition over mating opportunities has been observed in all but C. fordi . In agreement with predictions, evidence for TSD has been found in all species but C. fordi (Harlow, A major limitation of this study is that we cannot rule out temperature‐by‐sex effects on mortality as an explanation for the observed differences in sex ratio among the tested incubation temperatures. This effect could be present during the egg stage leading to a greater mortality of one sex during embryogenesis and thus creating a false impression of TSD. An alternative explanation for the high proportion of unhatched eggs in this study is that they were never fertilized in the first place. In another study of the same species, they report on a hatching success consistently over 81% (Tobler, Healey, & Olsson, We found a significant temperature‐by‐sex effect on posthatching mortality (Supporting information Table

Parental effects Parental effects on sex ratio has been found in C. pictus (present study; Uller et al., C. pictus offers interesting opportunities for further research. It is, however, more likely that the parental effect on sex ratio in this study is maternally derived, as previously shown by Uller et al. ( To date, research on C. pictus demonstrates an increasingly complex sex determination system, including effects of incubation temperature and possibly genetic and epigenetic factors (Harlow, Chelodina longicollis (Ezaz et al.,

10.1002_ece3.5260,"Abstract Targeted capture and enrichment approaches have proven effective for phylogenetic study. Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) in particular have exhibited great utility for phylogenomic analyses, with the software package phyluce being among the most utilized pipelines for UCE phylogenomics, including probe design. Despite the success of UCEs, it is becoming increasing apparent that diverse lineages require probe sets tailored to focal taxa in order to improve locus recovery. However, factors affecting probe design and methods for optimizing probe sets to focal taxa remain underexplored. Here, we use newly available beetle (Coleoptera) genomic resources to investigate factors affecting UCE probe set design using phyluce . In particular, we explore the effects of stringency during initial design steps, as well as base genome choice on resulting probe sets and locus recovery. We found that both base genome choice and initial bait design stringency parameters greatly alter the number of resultant probes included in final probe sets and strongly affect the number of loci detected and recovered during in silico testing of these probe sets. In addition, we identify attributes of base genomes that correlated with high performance in probe design. Ultimately, we provide a recommended workflow for using phyluce to design an optimized UCE probe set that will work across a targeted lineage, and use our findings to develop a new, open‐source UCE probe set for beetles of the suborder Adephaga.","INTRODUCTION The phylogenomics revolution is underway with targeted capture and enrichment approaches (Mamanova et al., Another advantage to the use of UCEs is the ability to develop probe sets that target thousands of orthologous loci across members of a select organismal group, based on low coverage genomic reads from relatively few exemplar taxa (Faircloth, Dendroctonus ponderosae ) in the design of the Coleoptera UCE probe set by Faircloth ( In spite of the apparent need for probe sets tailored to focal taxa, factors affecting probe design and methods for optimizing probe sets to focal taxa remain largely underexplored (Branstetter et al., In this study, we investigate factors affecting probe set design of UCE loci. In particular, we investigate the effect of base genome choice and initial bait design parameters on the resulting probe set, and the number of UCE loci recovered during in silico tests. Currently, there are relatively few thorough workflows or pipelines and associated programs for identifying conserved loci and designing baits targeting them (Campana, phyluce (Faircloth, phyluce to identify and design baits targeting UCE loci. Based on our results, we provide recommendations and discuss considerations for base genome choice and parameter selections to optimize the design of UCE probe sets using phyluce . Our findings are then applied to develop a new UCE probe set, optimized for beetles of the suborder Adephaga, using newly available genomic resources and incorporating previously published Coleoptera UCE loci.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Genomic resources and taxon information Genomic assemblies used in this study were generated using Illumina reads obtained from seven beetle species from the suborder Adephaga (Table clc genomics workbench version 9.5.3 (CLC Bio, referred to below as CLC GW), with the trim quality score limit set to 0.5, allowing for a maximum of two ambiguities per read, and searching on both strands to remove adapters, retaining broken pairs. De novo assemblies of paired, trimmed reads in CLC GW were generated using automatic word and bubble size, with the minimum contig length set to 200 bases. Genomic assembly metrics for the genomes used in this study are given in Table Study taxa and associated genomic assembly information.

However, the maximum evolutionary time separating our study species is approximately 250 million years, which is similar in age to the estimated split between turtles and archosaurs (Chiari, Cahais, Galtier, & Delsuc, Overview Using the above genomic resources and the software package phyluce , we developed multiple UCE probe sets while systematically altering key aspects of the design strategy. Throughout this study, we use the term “bait” to refer to the temporary bait sets targeting theoretical conserved loci (an intermediate stage in probe design), with “probe” referring to the final products of probe design (i.e., the set of RNA probes targeting UCE loci that would actually be synthesized, subject to in silico testing). First, we explored the effects of changing which taxon served as the base genome during probe design, a critical decision, as the genomic reads of all other taxa are mapped to this genome in order to identify conserved loci. The second round of experiments focused on the effects of changing the stringency parameters used during temporary bait design in phyluce . Our general workflow for using phyluce to develop probe sets, and the specific methods for our experimentation are provided below. We evaluated the success of the different probe sets by tracking the number of loci identified and/or recovered during the different stages of probe design within phyluce , the number of probes developed, and finally by comparison of the UCE loci recovered during in silico tests. After producing optimized probes, we filtered the probe set to a subset of probes targeting only those loci found within all seven taxa that appear paralogy free. We then used baitstools as an additional check of our final subset of optimized probes in order to identify physical attributes that could affect their synthesis and in vitro utility. Finally, we investigated attributes of base genomes (e.g., assembly metrics and genetic distance from other study taxa) potentially correlated with improved probe design. Phyluce workflow overview A detailed workflow for using phyluce to identify UCE loci and to design probes targeting these loci is described by Faircloth ( phyluce work flow followed for our experiments is given in Figure putative loci : highly conserved loci shared among taxa (see Supporting Information for corresponding phyluce terminology and commands). Putative loci are those present in the base genome as well as a specified number of additional taxa. The stringency at this step is varied (Figure putative loci found within the base genome and at least one other taxon (“+1”, the least stringent, designated as “at least one other taxon” on Figure putative loci are defined as those found in the base genome and all six additional taxa). Temporary baits were then developed targeting these putative loci . These temporary baits were then aligned back to the genomic assemblies of all study taxa (Figure candidate loci : loci for which temporary baits consistently aligned across the genomes of multiple taxa (Figure candidate loci . Finally, an in silico test (Figure recovered loci (loci recovered in the in silico test) to evaluate the choices involved in probe set design rather than the final probe sets themselves was in part to emulate some of the stochastic variation likely to be seen attempting to recover these loci in vitro.

First, a single taxon was selected to serve as the base genome (Faircloth, stampy (Lunter & Goodson, putative loci shared among the base taxon and the remaining study taxa. In this base genome choice experiment, we then proceeded with the most stringent approach to temporary bait design, targeting only those putative loci shared across the base genome as well as all six other taxa (Figure candidate loci (where temporary baits consistently aligned across multiple genomes; Figure candidate loci found within all seven of the study taxa (the base genome plus all six other taxa) (Figure recovered loci by the probe set. Finally, the UCE loci extracted from each species during the in silico test were aligned using mafft (Katoh & Standley, gblocks (Castresana, phyluce using the command “phyluce_align_get_only_loci_with_min_taxa.” A maximum‐likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed on this matrix using raxml 8.8.1 (Stamatakis, These steps were repeated changing only the taxon that served as the base genome (Figure Following comparison of probe sets designed using different base genomes and their success at locus recovery, we investigated attributes of base genomes potentially correlated with their probe design success. These attributes included genomic assembly metrics such as average estimated read depth, N50, L50, N90, L90, Guanine and Cytosine (GC) percent content, and BUSCO completeness percentage (Simão, Waterhouse, Ioannidis, Kriventseva, & Zdobnov, Testing temporary bait design stringency's influence on probe design and locus recovery Following investigation into how base genome choice influences probe design and locus recovery, we experimented with relaxing temporary bait design stringency. This involved modifying the step in the phyluce workflow in which temporary baits are constructed based on the identification of putative loci shared among the aligned genomic data (Figure putative loci were required to be identified within when designing temporary baits (Figure putative loci found across the base genome and all six other taxa and ended by targeting those found across the base genome and at least one other taxon, the least stringent temporary bait design. We then proceeded to follow the same steps as in Section candidate loci present within all seven study taxa (Figure Lionepha to serve as the base genome throughout these tests as it performed moderately well during the base genome choice experiments, being neither the best, nor worst performing genome. After establishing that Pterostichus appeared to be the optimum base genome, we also repeated the temporary bait stringency experiment on this base genome, to ensure the results were robust to base genome choice. Comparison of resulting probe sets To establish which UCE loci were shared between the probe sets designed using different base genomes in Section phyluce (see Alexander 2018a under Data Accessibility for step‐by‐step commands). Loci with single BLAST matches across at least two base genomes for at least one taxon were characterized as: “good” (UCE loci that appeared to be single copy across all taxa across all base genomes), “problematic within taxa” (evidence of potential paralogy within one or more taxa where loci identified within a taxon using one base genome matched to multiple loci within that same taxon identified using a different base genome), and “problematic between taxa” (potential lineage‐specific paralogy: a UCE locus that appeared to be single copy across all base genomes within one taxon appeared to be present in multiple copies in at least one other taxon). We used the “good loci” to identify the base genomes that had the greatest success recovering loci across the seven taxa and that gave the longest alignment in each taxon. In vitro attributes of final subset of optimized probes We examined aspects of the final subset of optimized probes designed during this study that could potentially affect synthesis and in vitro utility. We gathered relevant information on the final optimized subset of probes designed during this study relevant to in vitro performance including GC% content, melting temperature (Tm), and sequence complexity, using baitstools (Campana, Genome assembly metrics We estimated depth of coverage for each genome by mapping reads to the subset of “good” UCE loci (identified using the methods in Section Additional genomic assembly metrics such as N50, L50, N90, L90, Guanine and Cytosine (GC) percent content, and completeness of conserved protein‐coding genes were generated using clc gw v9.5.3 (available from https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/ ), bbmap (Bushnell, Estimating relatedness of study taxa We inferred the relative divergence between the taxa in our study for several markers commonly used in phylogenetic investigations of Coleoptera: 18S, 28S, ArgK, CAD2, CAD4, wg , and COI.

RESULTS The effect of base genome choice on probe design and locus recovery The effect of base genome choice was evident at each stage of the workflow (Figure putative loci identified (Figure candidate loci (Figure recovered loci during the in silico test (Figure Amphizoa and Omoglymmius resulted in the fewest number of putative loci (Figure candidate loci (Figure recovered loci (Figure Number of putative loci (highly conserved loci shared among taxa) recovered using different base genomes during probe design Number of candidate loci (loci where temporary baits align across genomes of multiple taxa) shared among different numbers of taxa using different base genomes during probe design Number of recovered loci (UCE loci recovered during the in silico test) shared among different taxa for probe sets designed using different base genomes. All categories provide the sum total of unique loci recovered for that base genome across all taxa The taxa Bembidion , Lionepha , and Trachypachus performed considerably better as base genomes, resulting in more putative loci (Figure candidate loci (Figure recovered loci (Figure Chlaenius performed even better as the base genome and was the base genome that resulted in the largest number of putative loci shared among all six of the other taxa (Figure Chlaenius did not result in the most candidate loci found across all seven taxa (Figure recovered loci during the in silico test (including Chlaenius itself; Figure putative loci , while tracking general trends in a taxon's performance as the base genome, is not an accurate predictor of the best performing base genome for downstream locus detection and recovery.

Using Pterostichus as the base genome resulted in the largest number of candidate loci (Figure recovered loci (including the most recovered loci for Pterostichus itself; Figure Pterostichus as a base genome resulted in baits targeting several hundred (i.e., 8%) more loci than the second‐best performing genome, Chlaenius , concordantly reflected in the design of several thousand (i.e., ~7%) more probes (Data Pterostichus resulted in several hundred (i.e., 6%) more recovered loci during the in silico test (Figure Chlaenius , and the resulting concatenated final alignment across taxa was several hundred thousand base pairs (i.e., ~6%) longer than that of Chlaenius (Data Stringency of temporary bait design's effect on probe design and locus recovery The temporary bait design stringency experiments revealed less stringent parameters for bait design (i.e., requiring sharing of putative loci across fewer taxa) greatly improved the number of candidate loci identified (Figure recovered loci during the in silico test (Figure Number of candidate loci (loci where temporary baits align across genomes of multiple taxa) found across increasing numbers of taxa for each temporary bait design stringency (requiring loci to be found in the base genome +1 other taxon through to the base genome +6 taxa) Number of recovered loci (UCE loci recovered during the in silico test) in different taxa from probe sets designed using Lionepha and Pterostichus as base genomes and varying the temporary bait design stringency requirements (requiring loci to be found in the base genome +1 other taxon through to the base genome +6 taxa). The all category provides the sum total of unique loci recovered for that base genome across all taxa Optimized probe design The base genome choice experiments identified Pterostichus as the optimal base genome. The results from the stringency in temporary bait design experiments showed decreasing the number of taxa putative loci were required to be shared across increased both the number of final probes and the number of recovered loci during the in silico test (Figure Pterostichus to serve as the base genome and designed temporary probes under the least stringent requirements, targeting putative loci found within the base genome and at least one other taxon. Comparison of probe sets based on loci found across different probe designs Using the recovered loci (i.e., those identified during the in silico test) from the seven base genome choice experiments, as well as the final optimized Pterostichus +1 probe design, we identified 8,159 loci through BLAST that matched at 99% similarity across more than one base genome for at least one taxon (95% similarity results revealed very similar patterns, so these results are presented only in Data Pterostichus served as the base genome with temporary baits designed from putative loci found in just one other taxon ( Pterostichus +1 taxon), the largest number of “good loci” were recovered for each taxon in comparison with all other base genomes (Figure Pterostichus but absent in other lineages (Data Pterostichus (specifically Pterostichus +1 taxon) appeared to be the optimal base genome/stringency choice: It resulted in a larger number of loci where it gave the longest alignment for more taxa than the other base genomes (Data Number of “good loci” (UCE loci that appeared to be single copy across all taxa across all base genomes) recovered in different taxa from probe sets designed using different base genomes Final optimized probe set The optimized probe design ( Pterostichus +1 taxon) resulted in a probe set consisting of 145,599 probes, targeting 11,162 UCE loci. However, synthesizing and enriching this large number of probes and loci would be cost prohibitive for phylogenomic studies with large numbers of taxa. We therefore needed a way to naturally limit the number of probes included in the final probe set. The initial optimized probe set was filtered to a final set of probes targeting the 2,702 “good loci” detected in all seven taxa discussed in Section Ptersotichus +1 probes (i.e., the optimized probe design), as 858 loci were derived under other probe design parameters (i.e., different base genomes and temporary bait stringency). Therefore, the final subset of optimized probes targets 2,643 loci that appear paralogy free and are present within all seven study taxa. As part of the final probe set, we also included probes for 305 loci from the previous Coleoptera 1.1Kv1 probe set (Faircloth, In vitro attributes of the final subset of optimized probes (Appendix Assembly metrics of genomic resources used We used the 2,702 “good” UCE loci found across all seven taxa to estimate coverage depth for the genomes utilized in this study.

We determined that low coverage and missing data affected data quality for these taxa based on an evident correlation between low sequencing coverage and large genetic distance (Data

The effect of base genome choice on probe design and locus recovery The effect of base genome choice was evident at each stage of the workflow (Figure putative loci identified (Figure candidate loci (Figure recovered loci during the in silico test (Figure Amphizoa and Omoglymmius resulted in the fewest number of putative loci (Figure candidate loci (Figure recovered loci (Figure Number of putative loci (highly conserved loci shared among taxa) recovered using different base genomes during probe design Number of candidate loci (loci where temporary baits align across genomes of multiple taxa) shared among different numbers of taxa using different base genomes during probe design Number of recovered loci (UCE loci recovered during the in silico test) shared among different taxa for probe sets designed using different base genomes. All categories provide the sum total of unique loci recovered for that base genome across all taxa The taxa Bembidion , Lionepha , and Trachypachus performed considerably better as base genomes, resulting in more putative loci (Figure candidate loci (Figure recovered loci (Figure Chlaenius performed even better as the base genome and was the base genome that resulted in the largest number of putative loci shared among all six of the other taxa (Figure Chlaenius did not result in the most candidate loci found across all seven taxa (Figure recovered loci during the in silico test (including Chlaenius itself; Figure putative loci , while tracking general trends in a taxon's performance as the base genome, is not an accurate predictor of the best performing base genome for downstream locus detection and recovery. The best performing base genome was Pterostichus . Using Pterostichus as the base genome resulted in the largest number of candidate loci (Figure recovered loci (including the most recovered loci for Pterostichus itself; Figure Pterostichus as a base genome resulted in baits targeting several hundred (i.e., 8%) more loci than the second‐best performing genome, Chlaenius , concordantly reflected in the design of several thousand (i.e., ~7%) more probes (Data Pterostichus resulted in several hundred (i.e., 6%) more recovered loci during the in silico test (Figure Chlaenius , and the resulting concatenated final alignment across taxa was several hundred thousand base pairs (i.e., ~6%) longer than that of Chlaenius (Data

Stringency of temporary bait design's effect on probe design and locus recovery The temporary bait design stringency experiments revealed less stringent parameters for bait design (i.e., requiring sharing of putative loci across fewer taxa) greatly improved the number of candidate loci identified (Figure recovered loci during the in silico test (Figure Number of candidate loci (loci where temporary baits align across genomes of multiple taxa) found across increasing numbers of taxa for each temporary bait design stringency (requiring loci to be found in the base genome +1 other taxon through to the base genome +6 taxa) Number of recovered loci (UCE loci recovered during the in silico test) in different taxa from probe sets designed using Lionepha and Pterostichus as base genomes and varying the temporary bait design stringency requirements (requiring loci to be found in the base genome +1 other taxon through to the base genome +6 taxa). The all category provides the sum total of unique loci recovered for that base genome across all taxa

Optimized probe design The base genome choice experiments identified Pterostichus as the optimal base genome. The results from the stringency in temporary bait design experiments showed decreasing the number of taxa putative loci were required to be shared across increased both the number of final probes and the number of recovered loci during the in silico test (Figure Pterostichus to serve as the base genome and designed temporary probes under the least stringent requirements, targeting putative loci found within the base genome and at least one other taxon.

Comparison of probe sets based on loci found across different probe designs Using the recovered loci (i.e., those identified during the in silico test) from the seven base genome choice experiments, as well as the final optimized Pterostichus +1 probe design, we identified 8,159 loci through BLAST that matched at 99% similarity across more than one base genome for at least one taxon (95% similarity results revealed very similar patterns, so these results are presented only in Data Pterostichus served as the base genome with temporary baits designed from putative loci found in just one other taxon ( Pterostichus +1 taxon), the largest number of “good loci” were recovered for each taxon in comparison with all other base genomes (Figure Pterostichus but absent in other lineages (Data Pterostichus (specifically Pterostichus +1 taxon) appeared to be the optimal base genome/stringency choice: It resulted in a larger number of loci where it gave the longest alignment for more taxa than the other base genomes (Data Number of “good loci” (UCE loci that appeared to be single copy across all taxa across all base genomes) recovered in different taxa from probe sets designed using different base genomes

Final optimized probe set The optimized probe design ( Pterostichus +1 taxon) resulted in a probe set consisting of 145,599 probes, targeting 11,162 UCE loci. However, synthesizing and enriching this large number of probes and loci would be cost prohibitive for phylogenomic studies with large numbers of taxa. We therefore needed a way to naturally limit the number of probes included in the final probe set. The initial optimized probe set was filtered to a final set of probes targeting the 2,702 “good loci” detected in all seven taxa discussed in Section Ptersotichus +1 probes (i.e., the optimized probe design), as 858 loci were derived under other probe design parameters (i.e., different base genomes and temporary bait stringency).

Assembly metrics of genomic resources used We used the 2,702 “good” UCE loci found across all seven taxa to estimate coverage depth for the genomes utilized in this study.

Pairwise genetic distances between taxa Pairwise genetic distance rankings showed Pterostichus as having the smallest genetic distance from all other taxa in the six gene fragments commonly used in phylogenetic studies (28S, COI, CAD2, CAD4, wg , ArgK), with Amphizoa and Omoglymmius the largest genetic distances (Figure We found average genetic distance ranking based on the six gene dataset to be negatively correlated with a taxon's performance as the base genome as assessed by the total number of UCE loci recovered during in silico testing (Figure We attempted to validate the six gene genetic distance measure results with a larger data set by extracting 50 different nuclear protein‐coding loci directly from genomic assemblies of our study taxa (Appendix Lionepha , Omoglymmius , and Amphizoa ).

DISCUSSION Our study using adephagan beetles as an example demonstrates that altering the base genome used during probe design can greatly alter the number of resultant probes included in the final probe set, and more importantly, strongly affects the number of loci detected and recovered during in silico tests. The base genome that recovered the largest number of in silico loci, Pterostichus , also performed better at recovering the longest sequences across the seven taxa included in this study. As variable regions flanking core UCEs contain phylogenetically informative sequence data (Faircloth et al., putative loci shared across the base genome with as few as one other taxon, resulted in a significantly better final probe set design that detected and recovered more UCE loci during in silico testing. Considerations for selecting a base genome for probe design Although we expected at the outset that higher quality base genomes would result in better final probe sets, genomic assembly metrics such as measures of completeness, average read depth, contiguity, and GC content did not appear to correlate well with base genome performance (Figure Pterostichus , had relatively low genomic assembly metrics compared to most other taxa in the study (Table When introducing the workflow for using phyluce to identify and design baits targeting UCE loci, Faircloth ( phyluce is its ability to identify and design probe sets for such nonmodel organisms, without the necessity of a complete and annotated genome. Our results demonstrated that UCE probe design can be successfully optimized even while using a base genome whose genomic assembly is of lower coverage and limited quality as phyluce targets conserved regions that are present and shared among the study taxa, rather than searching for a priori known regions to target. We provide a framework for conducting base genome experiments as outlined above (Figure Why does a “relaxed” approach at the temporary bait design stage result in a better probe set? Perhaps most surprising among the results of our experiments regarding optimal probe set design are those pertaining to temporary bait design stringency. We anticipated a diminishing return in the number of candidate loci as the number of taxa putative loci were required to share decreased. This is because we expected putative loci initially identified as being shared among the base and only one, or a few other taxa, would be unlikely to also be present or detectable in all of the remaining taxa, thus preventing their inclusion as candidate loci (the step where we required the baits to target loci found in all seven taxa). However, we did not find this to be the case. Instead, we found that designing temporary baits based on putative loci shared among the base genome and as few as one other taxon resulted in significantly better probe design, detecting and recovering more UCE loci, as well as in a better performing probe set. Why this would be the case is not entirely clear. Faircloth, in his informal discussion within the phyluce Tutorial IV (available at: http://phyluce.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial-four.html ), suggests loci that are actually present can randomly fail to be detected by phyluce . Perhaps having a temporary bait design protocol with relaxed stringency enables the discovery of such “cryptic” loci shared among taxa. In this case, relaxed temporary bait design would be analogous to casting a wider net which captures both the “cryptic” and initially detected loci, which, when narrowed down later by more stringent parameters applied during final probe design (such as only targeting candidate loci present in all study taxa), results in more loci detected and recovered by the final probe set. It is also possible that this result is an artifact of the two different read mapping programs used by the phyluce pipeline (Faircloth, stampy (Lunter & Goodson, lastz (Harris, phyluce when aligning temporary baits back to entire genomic assemblies (Figure stampy (Faircloth pers. comm.). In vitro considerations While we focused here on the optimization of probes based on in silico testing, optimal parameters for in vitro enrichment of UCE probes have not been investigated thoroughly. Certain physical attributes are well known to affect probe efficacy, such as GC% content (Tewhey et al., Tailored UCE probe sets and universal utility When first introduced, one of the appeals of UCEs was their ability to enrich hundreds to thousands of homologous loci across a clade (Faircloth et al., The first Coleoptera probe set designed by Faircloth ( With an increase in the number of tailored probe sets, concern could be raised that this deflates the value of UCEs as different probe sets result in the recovery of different homologous loci, causing incompatibility between datasets and decreased “universality.” However, UCE probe set development and synthesis affords the ability to mix probes from different designs, diversifying the loci targeted while providing backward compatibility with older data sets (Branstetter et al.,

CONCLUSION Given the need to tailor UCE probe sets to focal taxa to improve locus recovery for use in phylogenomic studies and the increasing availability of genomic resources for diverse organisms, information about factors affecting probe design and methods for optimizing locus recovery are becoming increasingly important. We found an optimized UCE probe set depends on selection of an appropriate base genome and beginning probe design with less stringent temporary bait design parameters. We recommend the following workflow (Figure phyluce to design an optimized UCE probe set for organisms without a complete and well‐annotated genome available. First, the base genome experiments shown in Figure putative loci shared between the base genome and as few as one other taxon. Combined, these factors resulted in an optimized probe set for adephagan beetles, recovering the most UCE loci in in silico tests as well as the longest per‐locus alignments. We make this final optimized adephagan beetle probe set “Adephaga_2.9Kv1,” consisting of 38,948 probes, targeting 2,948 UCE loci, available under a public domain license (CC‐0), similar to the prior Coleoptera probe set designed by Faircloth ( Proposed workflow for designing an optimized universal UCE probe set using phyluce for taxa without a well‐annotated genome available

10.1002_ece3.5395,"Abstract Human‐induced changes in the climate and environment that occur at an unprecedented speed are challenging the existence of migratory species. Faced with these new challenges, species with diverse and flexible migratory behaviors may suffer less from population decline, as they may be better at responding to these changes by altering their migratory behavior. At the individual level, variations in migratory behavior may lead to differences in fitness and subsequently influence the population's demographic dynamics. Using lifetime GPS bio‐logging data from 169 white storks ( Ciconia ciconia ), we explore whether the recently shortened migration distance of storks affects their survival during different stages of their juvenile life. We also explore how other variations in migratory decisions (i.e., time, destination), movement activity (measured using overall body dynamic acceleration), and early life conditions influence juvenile survival. We observed that their first autumn migration was the riskiest period for juvenile white storks. Individuals that migrated shorter distances and fledged earlier experienced lower mortality risks. In addition, higher movement activity and overwintering “closer‐to‐home” (with 84.21% of the tracked individuals stayed Europe or North Africa) were associated with higher survival. Our study shows how avian migrants can change life history decisions over only a few decades, and thus it helps us to understand and predict how migrants respond to the rapidly changing world.","INTRODUCTION Migration is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has evolved as an adaptation to seasonally changing environments (Newton, One frequently studied migrant is the white stork Ciconia ciconia . Many studies provide detailed knowledge on this widely distributed, opportunistic species: European white storks were exclusively migratory, but in the last three decades, it has been reported that the subpopulation that migrates on the western flyway between Central Europe, Iberia, and western Africa is shortening its migratory distances. New wintering and resident behavior emerged on the Iberian Peninsula (Tortosa, Manez, & Barcell, Procambarus clarkii may be contributing to the resident behavior of storks (Gilbert et al., Like in many long‐lived birds, the first year of life is the most challenging period for a stork (Rotics et al.,

METHODS Dataset From 2013 to 2017, we equipped a total of 193 juvenile white storks from five different regions in Germany and Austria with solar GPS‐ACC loggers (e‐obs GmbH). The total weight of transmitter and harness was 66 g, corresponding to approximately 2% of the mean body mass of white storks (for details see Flack et al., SD : 228.824 ± 11.120). Overall, 169 fledglings were included in this study, see details of tagging year and location in Appendix Hazard factors influencing survival We examined the effect of the following migration decisions on survival: departure date, movement distances, wintering region, and overall movement activity. Migration departure date was defined as the first day with a latitudinal difference of −0.38°, representing a southward movement of approximately 50 km. We calculated the daily displacement distances (hereafter daily distance) as the distance between the first GPS locations of two consecutive days. Daily distances were log‐transformed. Wintering region was defined as the most southern point of the birds' first winter and grouped in three categories, that is, Europe (north of the Strait of Gibraltar), North Africa (between Strait of Gibraltar and 20°N), and Sub‐Saharan Africa (between 12 and 20°N). Additionally, we examined how different individual traits in early life influence juvenile survival. These included hatching rank, number of siblings, sex, and fledging date (defined as the first of two consecutive days during which the distance to the nest exceeded 500 m). Fledging and departure dates were converted to day of the year (DOY, i.e., 1–366). To delineate physical movement characteristics, we estimated movement activity levels using overall dynamic body acceleration (hereafter ODBA), often used as a proxy for energy expenditure and a potential indicator of an animal's internal state (Wilson et al., Survival analysis We defined three life phases to examine which factors impacted survival during these specific life history stages: postfledging period—after fledging and before migration onset; migration period—between departure date and September 30; and wintering period—between October 1 and February 28 of the following year (Rotics et al., After visualizing GPS and ACC data, we identified an individual as dead when one of the following criteria was met: (a) accelerometer data showed a flat line for more than 24 hr; (b) GPS positions were located inside a radius of 100 m for more than three consecutive days; or (c) we observed GPS locations along, near, or inside anthropogenic structures before the animal disappeared (e.g., houses, yards, roads identified using Google Earth). We confirmed or detected mortality by localizing the carcass in the field whenever possible. For each mortality event, we defined the death day as the first stationary or motionless day. Individuals that disappeared without any death criteria being met were marked as vanished. In total, 64 individuals survived until the end of their first winter; we identified 58 deaths in the field, 21 deaths using GPS and ACC data, six instances by locating the stork near to human structures (death event criteria iii), and 20 storks vanished due to unknown reasons. We had no incidents of birds losing their loggers. Also, we considered different tagging locations as a metapopulation and not differentiated them. We used the Kaplan–Meier estimator (Collett, Regularization and variable selection using Elastic Net were performed using the “glmnet” package in R v.3.3.3 (Friedman, Hastie, & Tibshirani, p ‐values of the individual covariates. All diagnostics were performed and plotted using the “survival” and “rms” packages in R v.3.3.3 (Harrell, Finally, we determined how sensitive the models are to any potential bias caused by nonrandom censoring (Collett, t = −3.355, df = 16.107, p = 0.004), and similar distances as dead individuals ( t = −0.066, df = 21.472, p = 0.948), a sensitivity analysis suggested that our findings are robust to dependent censoring (see detailed discussion in Appendix

Survival analysis We defined three life phases to examine which factors impacted survival during these specific life history stages: postfledging period—after fledging and before migration onset; migration period—between departure date and September 30; and wintering period—between October 1 and February 28 of the following year (Rotics et al., After visualizing GPS and ACC data, we identified an individual as dead when one of the following criteria was met: (a) accelerometer data showed a flat line for more than 24 hr; (b) GPS positions were located inside a radius of 100 m for more than three consecutive days; or (c) we observed GPS locations along, near, or inside anthropogenic structures before the animal disappeared (e.g., houses, yards, roads identified using Google Earth).

RESULTS Overall migration and survival pattern All juvenile white storks migrated along the well‐described western route, through the western European continent, and many crossed the Gibraltar Strait to reach finally the Sahel region or the coast of West Africa. The majority of deaths (84.88%) occurred on the European continent (Figure Movement trajectories of storks during the study period (i.e., postfledging time, first autumn migration, and wintering period). Filled circles indicate the death locations. Trajectories ending with open circles indicate censored individuals (alive or vanished). Trajectories are color‐coded based on the total number of survival days. The bottom right insert shows the survival curve with 95% confidence interval (shaded area). Short vertical lines indicate censored events. Dashed lines correspond to median survival time. (Background map from Natural Earth) Hazard factors During the postfledging period, 18 of 169 storks died. However, none of the covariates influenced survival during that period significantly. Thus, we mainly focus on migration and the wintering period. We found that survival during migration was influenced by daily movement activities (ODBA), daily migration distance, fledging date (as nonlinear effect), and the interaction between daily distance and fledging date (Appendix df = 8, R  2 = 0.453, log‐ratio test p = 0.000). Larger daily ODBA, shorter daily migration distance, and early fledging dates were linked to reduced mortality risks during migration (Figure Estimated log‐relative hazard of each covariate of the Cox model for the first autumn migration (a–d) and first winter (e, f), with histogram of data distribution at the bottom: (a) median daily migration overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), (b) fledging date, (c) median daily migration distance, (d) interaction between fledging date and migration distance, (e) median daily wintering ODBA, and (f) wintering region, that is, Europe (EU), North Africa (NA), and Sub‐Saharan Africa (SA). Black line or points represent the predicted values adjusted by the mean or the reference level of other model covariates. Gray bands or bars correspond to the 95% confidence limit. Dashed vertical or horizontal lines show the median value of covariates. DOY‐day of the year We found that during winter, median ODBA and wintering region affected juvenile survival (Appendix df = 3, R  2 = 0.202, log‐ratio test p = 0.007). Similar to migration, larger median daily ODBA reduced the mortality risk, after controlling for wintering regions (Figure

We found that survival during migration was influenced by daily movement activities (ODBA), daily migration distance, fledging date (as nonlinear effect), and the interaction between daily distance and fledging date (Appendix df = 8, R  2 = 0.453, log‐ratio test p = 0.000). Larger daily ODBA, shorter daily migration distance, and early fledging dates were linked to reduced mortality risks during migration (Figure Estimated log‐relative hazard of each covariate of the Cox model for the first autumn migration (a–d) and first winter (e, f), with histogram of data distribution at the bottom: (a) median daily migration overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA), (b) fledging date, (c) median daily migration distance, (d) interaction between fledging date and migration distance, (e) median daily wintering ODBA, and (f) wintering region, that is, Europe (EU), North Africa (NA), and Sub‐Saharan Africa (SA).

DOY‐day of the year We found that during winter, median ODBA and wintering region affected juvenile survival (Appendix df = 3, R  2 = 0.202, log‐ratio test p = 0.007). Similar to migration, larger median daily ODBA reduced the mortality risk, after controlling for wintering regions (Figure

DISCUSSION By exploring the lifetime tracks of juvenile white storks, we obtained a robust estimation of true survival rates and identified hazard factors in the early life stages of this long‐lived migrant. Our results showed that the first southward migration is the riskiest period for juvenile white storks. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that mortality risk increases with migration distance, a finding that is in accordance with other long‐distance migrants (Klaassen et al., Even though successful storks migrate shorter distances and benefitting from sufficient food and warmer temperatures in these southerly European regions (Martín, Onrubia, & Ferrer, Like in other species (Menu, Gauthier, & Reed, As an opportunistic species, white storks exhibit high levels of behavioral flexibility and can potentially adapt relatively fast to changing environments (Cuadrado, Sánchez, Barcell, & Armario, In the past few decades, we have witnessed that white storks change their behavior as a response to human‐caused alterations in their environmental surroundings, yet the future development of these behavioral changes is unclear. The number of white storks overwintering in Portugal has already increased tenfold in the last two decades (Catry et al., Neophron percnopterus no negative short‐term effects of the landfill closures have been documented (Katzenberger et al.,

10.1002_ece3.6144,"Abstract There is urgent need for effective and efficient monitoring of marine fish populations. Monitoring eggs and larval fish may be more informative than that traditional fish surveys since ichthyoplankton surveys reveal the reproductive activities of fish populations, which directly impact their population trajectories. Ichthyoplankton surveys have turned to molecular methods (DNA barcoding & metabarcoding) for identification of eggs and larval fish due to challenges of morphological identification. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of using metabarcoding methods on mock communities of known fish egg DNA. We constructed six mock communities with known ratios of species. In addition, we analyzed two samples from a large field collection of fish eggs and compared metabarcoding results with traditional DNA barcoding results. We examine the ability of our metabarcoding methods to detect species and relative proportion of species identified in each mock community. We found that our metabarcoding methods were able to detect species at very low input proportions; however, levels of successful detection depended on the markers used in amplification, suggesting that the use of multiple markers is desirable. Variability in our quantitative results may result from amplification bias as well as interspecific variation in mitochondrial DNA copy number. Our results demonstrate that there remain significant challenges to using metabarcoding for estimating proportional species composition; however, the results provide important insights into understanding how to interpret metabarcoding data. This study will aid in the continuing development of efficient molecular methods of biological monitoring for fisheries management.","INTRODUCTION Marine ecosystems can change rapidly in response to both natural and anthropogenic changes in the environment. Monitoring changes in the abundance and distribution of marine organisms is a challenging but critical component of conservation efforts and natural resource management. Human impacts such as overfishing, coastal development, and pollution can rapidly increase stress on ecosystems resulting in an urgent need to develop efficient methods for monitoring spatial and temporal dynamics of biodiversity (Beng et al., Fisheries management has long used ichthyoplankton surveys as a component of monitoring because sampling the early life stages of fish reflects the reproductive activities of fish populations, a sensitive indicator of population growth or decline (Alstrom & Moser, Metabarcoding provides an alternative to traditional barcoding that involves analysis of pooled samples of individuals (potentially belonging to many species) using next‐gen sequencing (NGS) (Cristescu, Relatively few studies have assessed the quantitative accuracy of metabarcoding results for diverse DNA samples. For example, it has generally been assumed that the proportion of reads obtained for a given species is proportional to the contribution of DNA from that species within the sample relative to DNA from other taxa (Amend, Seifert, & Bruns, In the current study, we examine the efficacy of metabarcoding protocols on mock communities created with known ratios of input fish eggs and on a natural community that was simultaneously analyzed by traditional barcoding. We constructed six mock communities of at least 100 fish eggs that were previously sequenced and identified using DNA barcoding. Additionally, we analyzed two sets of 500 unknown fish eggs from a natural collection to compare to a large sample ( n = 1,000) of individually identified eggs from the same natural collection. We used the Illumina MiSeq platform to perform metabarcoding with sequences of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), and mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA both separately and in combination to examine the extent to which next‐gen sequencing results can (a) detect presence of species in mixed samples and (b) identify the relative proportions of species in a community. These data are critical for understanding how to interpret and draw conclusions from metabarcoding data used in biological monitoring and fisheries management.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling locations and techniques Weekly plankton samples were collected from two sites. (a) Plankton samples were collected from the end of Scripps Pier (32.8328°N, −117.2713°W) from August 2014 to August 2017. Samples were collected by lowering a 505‐micron mesh one‐meter‐diameter plankton net until the net reached the seafloor around midday each sampling day. This was repeated three more times for a total of four pulls, sampling a total of approximately 16 cubic meters of water (based on average water depth of about 5 m). (b) Weekly plankton samples were collected from kelp forest habitat adjacent to the Matlahuayl Marine Reserve (32.85408°N, 117.28105°W) from February 2017 to August 2017. These latter samples were collected by pulling a 333‐micron mesh one half‐meter‐diameter plankton net behind a small boat at 0.5 knots for 5 min. The net was weighted for a sampling depth of about 1 m, sampling approximately 60 cubic meters of water. The collected plankton samples from both sites were manually sorted using a dissecting microscope, and fish eggs were individually counted and removed. The Northern Anchovy ( Engraulis mordax ) and Pacific sardine eggs ( Sardinops sagax ), both morphologically distinct, were counted and removed from the sample. The remaining eggs were stored in 95% ethanol at 4°C for at least 12 hr prior to further processing. Identification of individual fish eggs Individual fish eggs were rinsed with molecular‐grade water and placed in 15 μl of buffer (2/3 Qiagen AE buffer, 1/3 molecular‐grade water). Eggs were then physically squished with a clean pipette tip to release the DNA. No further DNA extraction or purification was necessary. Samples were stored at −20°C prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To amplify DNA, we used universal fish cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) primers (Ward, Zemlak, Innes, Last, & Hebert, ( Palumbi, Mock community construction Six mock communities were constructed by combining the extracts of individual fish eggs (i.e., the remainder of the squished fish egg and Qiagen AE buffer) that had been previously identified. Each sample consisted of at least 100 eggs representing between 4 and 17 species in either equal or skewed proportions (Table c oxidase subunit I (COI) primers, (b) mitochondrial 16S ribosomal rRNA gene (16S), and (c) multiplexed both COI and 16S primers in a single reaction. Again, these markers were chosen to take advantage of the near‐complete barcode database for California marine fish using these genes. Mock communities were amplified using the following PCR protocol: PCR was performed using 25 μl reaction volume, with 12.5 μl of GoTaq Green Master Mix, 5 pmol of each primer, and 1 μl of DNA extract. When the PCR was multiplexed (simultaneous use of the two primer pairs), the final concentration of each primer was 5 pmol and 2.5 pmol for COI and 16S, respectively. GoTaq was selected because we high a high success rate identifying individual eggs using this master mix; although it lacks 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (i.e., proofreading), the relatively rare (10 –5 ) error rate is unlikely to cause any problems given our species identification criterion of 97% identity. Thermal cycling was initiated at 95°C for 2 min followed by 25 or 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 72°C for 5 min. After PCR, samples were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with GelRed or SybrSafe to detect presence of amplified DNA. We used 25 amplification cycles in some of our PCRs in an effort to reduce amplification bias (Pawluczyk et al., List of species that constituted six mock communities and their proportion in each mock community Species MC1 MC2 MC3 MC4 MC5 MC6  Anisotremus davidsonii  0 0 0 0 0.050 0.02  Cheilotrema saturnum  0 0 0 0 0 0.01  Chilara taylori  0 0 0.010 0 0 0  Citharichthys stigmaeus  0.25 0 0 0 0.010 0  Cynoscion parvipinnis  0 0 0 0 0 0.04  Engraulis mordax  0.25 0.571 0 0 0.050 0  Etrumeus acuminatus  0 0 0 0 0 0.01  Genyonemus lineatus  0 0 0.030 0 0 0.02  Halichoeres semicinctus  0 0.057 0.168 0.7 0.099 0  Hippoglossina stomata  0 0 0 0 0 0.01  Menticirrhus undulatus  0 0 0 0.1 0.050 0  Oxyjulis californica  0.25 0 0.495 0 0 0  Paralabrax clathratus  0 0.086 0 0 0 0.03  Paralichthys californicus  0.25 0.029 0.149 0 0.099 0.2  Pleuronichthys coenosus  0 0 0 0 0 0.01  Pleuronichthys verticalis  0 0 0 0 0 0.02  Roncador stearnsii  0 0.057 0.099 0 0 0.03  Sardinops sagax  0 0.057 0 0 0.198 0.01  Scomber japonicus  0 0.057 0 0 0.198 0.25  Semicossyphus pulcher  0 0.057 0 0 0 0.01  Seriphus politus  0 0.029 0.050 0.1 0 0.02  Trachurus symmetricus  0 0 0 0 0.050 0.01  Xenistius californiensis  0 0 0 0.1 0.198 0.3 Total 100 175 101 100 101 100 Note Total indicated is the total number of fish eggs used to construct the mock community. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd In addition to the mock communities, we analyzed one large natural plankton sample form the kelp forest that contained approximately 4,500 fish eggs. From this large collection, two random samples of 500 eggs were processed separately using the metabarcoding protocol described above for the mock communities. Another subset of 1,000 fish eggs from the same collection was individually Sanger sequenced using methods described above (i.e., traditional barcoding). Each mock community (6) and natural community (2) was amplified in four replicate PCRs with COI and 16S primer pairs separately (8 communities × 2 primer sets × 4 replicates = 64 libraries). Then, each of the six mock communities was again amplified in four reactions and replicate reactions were pooled before sequencing to compare the effects of pooling samples after amplification and before sequencing (6 mock communities × 2 primer sets = 12 libraries). Additionally, mock communities one through four were amplified in four replicate reactions with COI and 16S primer pairs in the same reaction to compare the effects of multiplexing primer pairs to single primer pair reactions (4 mock communities × 1 primer combination × 4 replicates = 16 libraries). Mock communities five and six were not included multiplexed with 16S and COI due to limitations on space in our sequencing run. After amplification, PCR products were cleaned using Sephadex G‐50 Fine and quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ds HS Assay, Life Technologies). Samples were diluted to 0.02 ng/µl. A total of 92 libraries were then prepared using the Nextera XT Illumina protocol (Table Data preprocessing and taxonomic assignment Overall quality of MiSeq reads was evaluated in FastQC. The Nextera transposase sequences were trimmed from the target region. Low‐quality tails and Nextera adaptors were trimmed from the sequencing reads in CLC Genomics Workbench (Qiagen) with quality limit 0.01. Only reads with at least 100 retained base pairs were used in the analysis (details of the algorithm and its implementation are available in the CLC Genomics Workbench user manual). Broken pairs (paired‐end reads that were unmerged) and orphan reads were discarded. For each library, species were identified by mapping the reads to a reference library constructed from over 1,000 fish sequences of COI and 16S sequences ( Seriphus politus and Etrumeus acuminatus ) included in our constructed libraries did not have 16S rRNA sequences in NCBI. We obtained tissue samples from voucher specimens for these species from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Marine Vertebrate Collection, extracted and sequenced their DNA and submitted these sequences to GenBank (accession numbers: MH714866 and MH718435). The total number of reads per species was mapped and counted using RNA‐seq analysis tools in CLC at 97% similarity to a local reference database. While this method may result in some loss of taxonomic signal via fragmentation of amplicons, we accounted for this by only counting reads that mapped uniquely to one species. Data analysis All data analyses and statistics were conducted in R. Total reads that mapped to a given species were counted and divided by the total number of reads mapped for the library to find the proportion of that species in the library. For samples where COI and 16S were multiplexed, the total species proportion was calculated based on the number of reads for each primer in a library to allow for separate analysis of both primer sets in multiplexed samples. The average number of missed species per library for each primer set was determined, and differences across primer sets and input species were assessed by two‐way ANOVA. We modeled detection of low‐frequency species (<~10% of a mock community) using a logistic regression with primer set and species as categorical variables. Differences between observed and expected proportional read counts for each primer set were assessed by ANCOVA with expected proportions as a covariate, and primers as a categorical variable.

RESULTS The total number of reads generated was 15,197,856, and the average length of each read was 300 bp. After filtering and trimming, 1,297,257 were retained. Filtering reads after trimming of the Illumina transposase resulted in the greatest loss of mappable reads. Reads in both directions were mapped to the reference library. The average number of reads for each library was 13,853 ± 670 SEM , with a minimum of 2,357 and maximum of 32,543 (Figure Detection in mock communities Overall, 60% of all libraries were able to detect all of the species that were input into mock communities (48/80). Forty percent (12/30) and sixty‐six percent (20/30) of all libraries amplified with COI primers or 16S primers were able to detect all the input species, respectively. These two primer sets were significantly different in their ability to detect all input species ( χ  2 = 3.28, df = 1, p < .05). Seventy‐six percent of libraries that were multiplexed were able to detect all species; this was not significantly different from COI and 16S primer set's detection rate, though overall power is low ( χ  2 = 1.36, df = 2, p > .05). Libraries that included more species were less likely to detect all of the species present ( F = 163.50, 63.75, 37.94, df = 4,2,6, p < .01; Figure Average number of species that were not detected in libraries of mock communities of fish eggs with various numbers of input species from four to seventeen. Mock communities 5 and 6 were not analyzed with multiplexed primers Of the 23 different species included in the mock communities, 5 species were not consistently detected by COI primers: Etrumeus acuminatus , Genyonemus lineatus , Pleuronichthys verticalis , Roncador stearnsii , and Sardinops sagax . All of these species comprised <6% of the mock communities in which they were placed, with the exception of Sardinops sagax . With COI primers, Sardinops sagax was missed in three out of four libraries where it comprised 20% of the eggs. By comparison, the same mock communities amplified by 16S primers detected Sardinops sagax 100% of the time. This species in particular is known to not amplify well with COI primers (A. Harada, D. Kacev, pers comm) but can be easily identified morphologically (Harada et al., Sardinops sagax amplified with COI primers, every species that was in a mock community at a frequency of 6% or greater was detected 100% of the time (Figure χ  2 = 259.66, 11.78, df = 2, 20, p < .01; Figure Genyonemus lineatus was missed by libraries amplified with all three primer combinations (COI, 16S, or multiplexed). This species was not detected in two of the mock communities (3,6) where it comprised 2%, and 3% of the eggs, respectively. It is remarkable that many species that were in mock communities at frequencies as low as 1% were reliably detected by both COI and 16S primer sets (Figure Probability of detection for a species was calculated based on the number of times that species was detected with specific primer sets at a certain expected proportion. Expected proportion based on the number of fish eggs of that species used in a mock community We detected low levels of false positives in our samples which were species that were not included in our mock community but found in the sequenced libraries. Ninety‐two percent of false positives that were detected comprised <1% of the total reads in the library (Figure Relative proportions Across all libraries, we found a positive relationship between the expected and observed proportions of reads for each species in a library, ( R  2 = .66) calculated around a 1:1 line (Figure E. mordax comprised 5% of the eggs in mock community five (MC5) but accounted for 43% of the total reads in that library. Conversely, in some cases we found a <0.01% difference in proportion between the observed read count and expected number of reads based on number of eggs. While this is a large range of error, 74% of the differences between observed and expected proportions fell within 0 and 0.10 (Figure F = 14.70, 0.076, 5.75, p < .01). There was a significant interaction between expected proportion and primers used. We observed that samples that were multiplexed or independently amplified with each primer set gave similar final estimates for each species (Figure Linear regression between the proportions of eggs of a given species in relation to the number of reads detected of that species for all libraries.

Detection in mock communities Overall, 60% of all libraries were able to detect all of the species that were input into mock communities (48/80). Forty percent (12/30) and sixty‐six percent (20/30) of all libraries amplified with COI primers or 16S primers were able to detect all the input species, respectively. These two primer sets were significantly different in their ability to detect all input species ( χ  2 = 3.28, df = 1, p < .05). Seventy‐six percent of libraries that were multiplexed were able to detect all species; this was not significantly different from COI and 16S primer set's detection rate, though overall power is low ( χ  2 = 1.36, df = 2, p > .05). Libraries that included more species were less likely to detect all of the species present ( F = 163.50, 63.75, 37.94, df = 4,2,6, p < .01; Figure Average number of species that were not detected in libraries of mock communities of fish eggs with various numbers of input species from four to seventeen. Mock communities 5 and 6 were not analyzed with multiplexed primers Of the 23 different species included in the mock communities, 5 species were not consistently detected by COI primers: Etrumeus acuminatus , Genyonemus lineatus , Pleuronichthys verticalis , Roncador stearnsii , and Sardinops sagax . All of these species comprised <6% of the mock communities in which they were placed, with the exception of Sardinops sagax . With COI primers, Sardinops sagax was missed in three out of four libraries where it comprised 20% of the eggs. By comparison, the same mock communities amplified by 16S primers detected Sardinops sagax 100% of the time. This species in particular is known to not amplify well with COI primers (A. Harada, D. Kacev, pers comm) but can be easily identified morphologically (Harada et al., Sardinops sagax amplified with COI primers, every species that was in a mock community at a frequency of 6% or greater was detected 100% of the time (Figure χ  2 = 259.66, 11.78, df = 2, 20, p < .01; Figure Genyonemus lineatus was missed by libraries amplified with all three primer combinations (COI, 16S, or multiplexed). This species was not detected in two of the mock communities (3,6) where it comprised 2%, and 3% of the eggs, respectively. It is remarkable that many species that were in mock communities at frequencies as low as 1% were reliably detected by both COI and 16S primer sets (Figure Probability of detection for a species was calculated based on the number of times that species was detected with specific primer sets at a certain expected proportion. Expected proportion based on the number of fish eggs of that species used in a mock community We detected low levels of false positives in our samples which were species that were not included in our mock community but found in the sequenced libraries. Ninety‐two percent of false positives that were detected comprised <1% of the total reads in the library (Figure

Relative proportions Across all libraries, we found a positive relationship between the expected and observed proportions of reads for each species in a library, ( R  2 = .66) calculated around a 1:1 line (Figure E. mordax comprised 5% of the eggs in mock community five (MC5) but accounted for 43% of the total reads in that library. Conversely, in some cases we found a <0.01% difference in proportion between the observed read count and expected number of reads based on number of eggs. While this is a large range of error, 74% of the differences between observed and expected proportions fell within 0 and 0.10 (Figure F = 14.70, 0.076, 5.75, p < .01). There was a significant interaction between expected proportion and primers used. We observed that samples that were multiplexed or independently amplified with each primer set gave similar final estimates for each species (Figure Linear regression between the proportions of eggs of a given species in relation to the number of reads detected of that species for all libraries.

DISCUSSION Our overall objective was to evaluate the efficacy of metabarcoding protocols on ichthyoplankton to determine species presence and relative abundance using mock communities of fish eggs. These communities were constructed using both even and skewed species abundances. We also used a natural collection to compare results from metabarcoding and traditional DNA barcoding methods. Our results demonstrate that metabarcoding protocols were able to (a) detect all high‐abundance species and many of the low‐abundance species placed mock communities, and (b) determine high‐abundance species and low‐abundance species with both even and skewed species abundances. Detection In general, species that comprised over six percent of a mock community were reliably detected in our metabarcoding results. Species that comprised <6% of a mock community were detected with varying frequency depending on the primers used and its relative proportion in the mock community. As the number of species per library increased, the ability to detect all species decreased. Furthermore, for both for COI and 16S libraries, the highest variability in number of species detected occurs in libraries with the most species (Figure Detection of low‐abundance species varied with the primer set that was used in amplification. This variation is likely the result of differences in the binding efficiencies of primer pairs across template differences for certain species (Clarke, Soubrier, Weyrich, & Cooper, Sardinops sagax eggs comprised 20% of a mock community, it was not detected in our libraries constructed with COI primers. This is consistent with other observations that these primers do not work well with this particular species (in fact, S. sagax eggs are morphologically distinct so they have been omitted from some molecular identification studies (e.g., Harada et al., We found generalized differences between primer pairs and their ability to detect all species in a mock community, with 16S detecting proportionally more species than COI in our study. Similarly, Evans et al. ( Relative proportion There was a positive relationship between the proportions of reads obtained from a given species and the proportion of eggs that was combined in the mock community, though there was reasonable amount of variability ( R  2 = .66). These results are consistent with other metabarcoding studies that have found a positive relationship between species abundance and species read abundance (Evans et al., When a low‐abundance species is undetected or underrepresented (i.e., failed amplification), this will result in proportional overrepresentation of other taxa in the sample (Deagle et al., Engraulis mordax ) in MC1, MC2, and MC5 is overrepresented across all primer sets used (Figure Quite interestingly, our results showed that regardless if primer pairs were used independently or multiplexed, estimates from each amplicon (COI or 16S) were consistent across species (Figure We detected low levels of false positives in our samples, which are likely due to mapping error, cross‐contamination in the laboratory, or potentially eDNA stuck on the fish egg surfaces (Fritts et al., Seriola rivoliana (Table Seriola lalandi within the same genus and a comparison of 16S rRNA sequences on GenBank shows that the species divergence is approximately 3%, right at our mapping cutoff. There were also species that we have seen in our laboratory that likely resulted from low‐level cross‐contamination of samples during PCR cleanup or library prep. These observations suggest that the move to next‐gen sequencing requires additional care be given to laboratory procedures needed to prevent low levels of post‐PCR cross‐contamination that generally have little impact on Sanger sequencing results. Notably, most false positives comprised a very small proportion of the overall library and could be eliminated by removing reads that fall below some threshold proportion of the total library. Additionally, future studies should include negative controls, which are often uncommon in metabarcoding studies, but could help reveal sources of laboratory contamination. Our mock communities present a kind of negative control in that the eggs in each library were known entities based on standard barcoding; for example, MC1 and MC4 were “negative controls” for all species other than 4 included in each mix. However, true negative controls in addition to mock communities may help to understand rates of false positives in future sequencing analyses. Considering the broad range of factors that could reduce the accuracy of metabarcoding, we found our results rather promising. First, we note that are many different ways to prepare samples (we used bead beating and Qiagen's DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit), amplify target genes (we used a nonproofreading GoTaq), prepare sequencing libraries (we used Illumina's Nextera XT kit); we did not systematically explore other options in this study. Although GoTaq does not have 3′→5′ exonuclease activity (“proofreading”), PCR error is not likely to be a confounding issue when sequence matching for species identification is only at 97% stringency; in fact, PCR error with Taq is likely one or more orders of magnitude lower than Illumina sequencing error (see Pfeiffer et al.,

10.1002_ece3.6303,"Abstract Polyploidy can cause variation in plant functional traits and thereby generate individuals that can adapt to fluctuating environments and exploit new environments. However, few empirical studies have tested for an association between ploidy level and climatic tolerance of invasive cytotypes relative to conspecific native‐range cytotypes. Here, we used an invasive plant Solidago canadensis to test whether invasive populations had a higher proportion of polyploids, greater height and stem‐base diameter, and occupied a wider range of climatic conditions than conspecific native‐range populations. We also tested whether the invasive populations had overcome genetic founder effects. We sampled a total of 80 populations in parts of the invaded range in China and native range in North America for in situ measurements of plant height and stem‐base diameter in the field and for population genetic and cytotype analyses. To examine climatic correlates, we augmented our field‐sampled data with occurrence records obtained from Global Biodiversity Information Facility. All, except one, of the populations that we sampled in China occurred in a humid subtropical climate. In contrast, the North American populations occurred in humid continental, humid subtropical, and semi‐arid climatic zones. All populations of S. canadensis in China were purely hexaploid, while the North American populations were diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid. The invasive hexaploids were significantly taller and had a larger stem‐base diameter than native hexaploids. Native hexaploids were significantly taller and had larger stem‐base diameter than native diploids. Climatic correlate assessment found that invasive and native populations occupied different climatic envelopes, with invasive populations occurring in warmer and less seasonal climates than native populations. However, there was no significant correlation between ploidy level and climatic envelope of S. canadensis . Molecular phylogeography data suggest reduced genetic founder effects in the invaded range. Overall, these results suggest that polyploidy does not influence S. canadensis climatic tolerance.","INTRODUCTION Invasions by exotic plant species pose substantial threats to native biodiversity and alter ecosystem processes across a broad range of environments (McGeoch et al., Polyploidy (i.e., whole genome duplication) can cause variation in plant morphology, phenology, and physiology and thereby generate individuals that can adapt to fluctuating environments, exploit new environments, or outcompete progenitor diploids (te Beest et al., Centaurea maculosa (Muller, Lythrum salicaria (Kubatova et al., Centaurea stoebe in North America (Mráz, Tarbush, & Müller‐Schärer, Solidago gigantea (Schlaepfer, Edwards, & Billeter, Senecio inaequidens in Europe (Monty, Maurice, & Mahy, Solidago canadensis in China (Li, Liu, Yan, & Du, Lilium lancifolium in Europe and North America (Chung et al., C. maculosa found that invasive‐range tetraploid populations occupied a drier climate than conspecific native‐range tetraploid populations (Treier et al., C. maculosa cytotypes, but was instead correlated with original latitudinal clines within cytotypes (Mráz et al., It also remains unresolved whether a pronounced shift in cytotype distribution that has been reported in several invasive plant species is due to stochastic genetic founder events or adaptive evolutionary processes. Population genetic theory predicts that invasive species are likely to experience genetic founder effects, which may reduce their ability to adapt to novel environmental conditions (Dlugosch & Parker, Here, we used the invasive plant S. canadensis to test a prediction that polyploidy can enable invasive plant species to colonize a wider range of climatic conditions. Specifically, we combined a cytobiogeographical approach, estimates of functional traits and climatic correlates, and molecular phylogeography methods to test whether invasive populations of S. canadensis: 1) had a higher proportion of polyploids, 2) were larger, 3) had a wider climatic tolerance, and 4) had overcome founder effects, relative to native populations of S. canadensis .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Study species  Solidago canadensis L. (Asteraceae) is a rhizomatous clonal perennial forb native to North America and has invaded China and other regions (Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan) (Abhilasha, Quintana, Vivanco, & Joshi, Solidago canadensis reproduces both clonally and sexually (Li et al., S. canadensis was first introduced to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai provinces in the early 1930s as an ornamental garden species (Xu et al., Sampling and functional trait measurement To identify occurrence locations of S. canadensis in China and North America, we conducted field surveys in summer and autumn for the period 2013–2016. We sampled a total of 2,051 S. canadensis individuals in 19 native and 61 invasive populations. The number of individuals sampled per population ranged from five to 33. The native range in North America was represented by 577 individuals, while the invaded range in China was represented by 1,474 individuals (Appendix 1). Any two sample populations were at least 5 km apart. In each population, we sampled at random plants that occurred within a radius of 10–20 m to minimize a potential bias due to environmental heterogeneity within a population (e.g., soil moisture and nutrients). To avoid sampling plants from the same genet within the same radius, we sampled plants that were at least two meters apart from each other. For each S . canadensis individual, we took in situ measurements of stem‐base diameter and plant height (in cm). These functional traits are generally linked to ecological strategy axes of plants. As a plant developmental stage (i.e., phenophase) can influence the values of these traits, we took measurements only from mature plants that had set seeds and were therefore presumably not undergoing further development in height and stem diameter. We omitted leaf measurements because an individual S. canadensis plant can have hundreds of leaves (especially in the non‐native range), and hence, finding the largest leaf for measurement can be extremely difficult. In the native range, the ecological niches of S. canadensis and those of its congeners S. gigantea and S. altissima overlap and the three species can coexist (Benelli et al., S. canadensis prefers loose and drier soils than the congeners, and hence, it occurs mostly near urban areas, roadsides, and railways, while the congeners occur mainly on riverside and embankments (Benelli et al., S. canadensis to avoid accidental sampling of the congeners. Moreover, we conducted a test of phylogenetic relatedness among the populations that we sampled in the field to determine whether they all belonged to S. canadensis (see the section on population genetics and phylogenetic analyses below). All the sampled populations in China occurred in a humid subtropical climate except one that occurred in a subtropical highland climate. In contrast, the North American populations were sampled from humid continental, humid subtropical, and semi‐arid climatic zones (Köppen–Geiger climate classification system) (Kottek, Grieser, Beck, Rudolf, & Rube, Determination of ploidy level We took fresh leaf samples from the same S. canadensis individuals used for functional trait measurements described above. The leaf materials were held in self‐sealing plastic bags containing silica and transported to the laboratory for ploidy level determination. We applied a modified flow cytometry method by Suda and Trávníček ( 2 , 30 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% v/v Triton X‐100, 0.5% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone) in a plastic Petri dish held on a chilled brick. A new razor blade was used for each leaf sample. The resultant fine slurry was filtered through a 600‐mesh nylon filter (Shanghai Aoran Hardware Market, Shanghai, China). The filtrate was held in a new 5‐ml centrifuge tube. The filtered slurry was then resuspended in a pre‐cooled 1 ml of extraction buffer in a Petri dish and then filtered again. The final filtrate was treated with 10 μL/ml of RNase A for 10 min at 4°C. Then, 200 μL/ml of a propidium iodide (PI) staining solution was added and incubated at 4°C for 30 min in darkness. The fluorescence strength of PI‐DNA conjugates was measured on Attune® NxT Acoustic Focusing Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA, USA) using a 488 nm laser and 590/40 emission filter. Leaf of the hexaploid S. canadensis (confirmed by cytometry and karyotype analysis) collected in Taizhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, was used as an external reference. Statistical analyses To test whether S. canadensis plants from the invaded range had significantly greater height and stem‐base diameter than S. canadensis plants from the native range, we fitted linear mixed‐effect models. In the models, a trait value was treated as a dependent variable, while S. canadensis range (invaded vs. native) was treated as a fixed‐effect independent variable. Population identity of S. canadensis was treated as a random‐effect factor and nested within range. To test whether polyploidy in general conferred higher mean trait values, we also fitted linear mixed‐effect models to test whether the functional trait values differed between hexaploid and diploid individuals in the native range. Because only hexaploids were found in the invaded range, this latter test was not possible for invasive plants. In the test, ploidy level (polyploid vs. diploid) was treated as a fixed‐effect independent variable, while S. canadensis population identity was treated as a random‐effect independent variable. We did additional analyses to test for the potential confounding effect of climate on trait expression by comparing traits of invasive plants with those of native plants from the same climatic zone only. As nearly all invasive plants were sampled in a humid subtropical climate, we used a subset of plants from this climatic zone only. We did separate comparisons for groups of plants that occurred in populations with mixed‐ploidy and for groups of plants that occurred in populations with one ploidy type. Moreover, we compared traits of diploid plants with those of hexaploid plants that occurred in mixed‐ploidy populations only to exclude the potential confounding effect of pure and mixed‐ploidy populations occupying habitats with contrasting ecological conditions. In all the analyses, we fitted the models using maximum likelihood with the lme function in the nlme package (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, & Sarkar, r v 3.5.2 (R Core Team, Assessing climatic tolerance We described the climatic space occupied by S. canadensis with 19 variables with a 30 arc‐sec resolution (~1 km) derived from the WorldClim database (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, & Jarvis, S. canadensis in China and North America, we collected information on occurrences of S. canadensis provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database ( http://www.gbif.org/ ) in order to assess more comprehensively the climatic tolerance of the species. We retained only the GBIF occurrence records in the native (United States, Canada, and Mexico) and invaded (Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China) ranges where the species is most widespread. Occurrences flagged as invalid (e.g., in the oceans) or with doubtful coordinates were removed as well as those separated by less than 30 arc‐seconds to avoid pseudo‐replication. We then extracted values of PC1 and PC2 for each of the 2,214 retained occurrence locations (i.e., our 80 field‐sampled records and 2,134 GBIF records, which included 1,624 records in the native range and 510 records in the invaded range). To test whether climatic space occupied by S. canadensis differed significantly between the invaded and native ranges, we calculated the kernel‐smoothed density of occurrence of the two ranges based on the density of the different combinations of climatic conditions available to each range (Broennimann et al., D metric, which ranges from 0 (no envelope overlap) to 1 (identical envelopes) (Schoener, D value between the two ranges was compared to a null distribution of D values computed between simulated envelopes built through randomization procedures (10,000 randomly selected “background” points generated 100 times). This was computed with the r package “ecospat” (Di Cola et al., D value does not allow a determination of whether an absence of envelope overlap results from the lack of overlap for one or two PCA axes, we used the function “niceOverPlot” implemented in R for easier interpretation. To test whether S. canadensis inhabited a wider range of climatic conditions in its invaded range than in the native range, we performed an F‐ test of equality of variances (homoscedasticity) along the two PCA axes. We also used the same method to compare the climatic zones occupied by diploid and hexaploid populations of S. canadensis in its native range. Finally, we compared D values and envelope equivalencies and similarities between the following groups of S. canadensis populations: 1) North American versus Chinese populations that we had sampled in the field and with the same ploidy level, 2) North American versus Chinese populations that we had sampled in the field and without controlling for variation in ploidy level, 3) a global data set (i.e., the 80 populations that we had sampled in the field and GBIF records) of North America and Mexico grouped together versus China, and 4) a global data set of North America and Mexico grouped together versus all occurrence records in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China. Comparisons 1 and 2 tested the potential effect of variation in ploidy, while comparisons 3 and 4 tested whether our sampling was representative of the invaded and native ranges. For comparisons 3 and 4, it was not possible to control for variation in ploidy level because information on ploidy level was missing in the GBIF database. Population genetic and phylogenetic analyses DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing To estimate gene flow in S. canadensis from North America to China and phylogenetic relationships among the 80 invasive and native populations that we sampled in the field, we sequenced two chloroplast spacer regions ( psbA‐trnH and trnL‐F ) using four universal primer pairs (Appendix 2) (de Andrade et al., 2+ , 4 ng template DNA, 0.15 μM each for forward and reverse primer, 0.3 mM 4 × dNTP mixture, and 1.5 U Taq polymerase (Promega Cooperation, Madison, Wisconsin, USA). PCR amplifications were performed in a PTC 220 Thermal Cycler (Bio‐Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA) as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at 57°C, 90 s at 72°C, with a final elongation of 20 min at 72°C. PCR products were then sequenced using ABI autosequencer by Sangon Biotechnology Company (Shanghai, China). All the 536 sequences were aligned using MEGA v 10.0.5 software (Kumar, Stecher, Li, Knyaz, & Tamura, Population genetic diversity and structure analyses To test whether patterns of genetic diversity differed between S. canadensis populations in the invaded (China) and native (North America) ranges, we used sequences of the chloroplast spacer regions ( psbA‐trnH and trnL‐F ) to estimate the number of polymorphic sites, the total number of haplotypes, haplotypic diversity ( H ), and nucleotide diversity ( d n ) using ARLEQUIN v 3.5.2.2 (Excoffier & Lischer, r v 3.5.2) to test whether S. canadensis populations from the invaded range differed significantly in mean values of the diversity indices from S. canadensis populations in the native range. In the models, the diversity indices were treated as dependent variables, while S. canadensis range (invaded vs. native) was treated as a fixed‐effect independent variable. Population identity of S. canadensis was treated as a random‐effect independent variable and nested within range. To test whether S. canadensis populations in the invaded range had a different genetic structure than S. canadensis populations in the native range, we used the same sequences above to perform hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) (Excoffier, Smouse, & Quattro, ST ) and tested by AMOVA in ARLEQUIN v 3.5.2.2 (Excoffier & Lischer, Testing for population demographic expansion Changes in demographic history can influence the frequency of alleles, the distribution of mutations, and the coalescent times of gene copies (Zhang, Edwards, Kang, & Fuller, F neutrality tests (Fu, S F indicate an excess of young or rare alleles in the genealogy, which suggest recent population expansion or purifying selection (Fu, S S. canadensis , we determined genealogical relationships among haplotypes using the statistical parsimony algorithm implemented in ARLEQUIN v 3.5.2.2 (Excoffier & Lischer, Analysis of phylogenetic relatedness To test whether all the 80 populations of S. canadensis that we sampled in the invaded and native ranges belonged to the same species (i.e., S. canadensis ), we performed analyses of phylogenetic relatedness using sequences of 34 haplotypes that were derived from 536 individual sequences of the two chloroplast spacer regions ( psbA‐trnH and trnL‐F ). We applied three methods, namely the Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Neighbor‐Joining. We performed Maximum Parsimony analyses with all characters equally weighted and gaps treated as missing data. For the Maximum Likelihood analyses, maximum likelihood trees were generated using the Jukes–Cantor model, the Gamma distributed with the Invariant Sites (G + I) option for the rates among sites, and use all the sites option for the Gaps/Missing Data Treatment . For the Neighbor‐Joining analysis, we applied the default settings. After 1,000 rapid bootstrap search step, bootstrap values of each node were visualized. As outgroups, we used sequences of the two chloroplast spacer regions ( psbA‐trnH and trnL‐F ) for S. canadensis seeds that we obtained from the Germplasm Resources Information Network of the United States Department of Agriculture (accession number W6 52,837) and a congener S. decurrens . The congener was collected from Kuocangshan Mountain in Linhai City, Zhejiang Province, China, and identified by Prof. Ming Jiang in Taizhou University, China. All phylogenetic analyses were performed with MEGA v 10.0.5 (Kumar et al.,

Study species  Solidago canadensis L. (Asteraceae) is a rhizomatous clonal perennial forb native to North America and has invaded China and other regions (Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan) (Abhilasha, Quintana, Vivanco, & Joshi, Solidago canadensis reproduces both clonally and sexually (Li et al., S. canadensis was first introduced to Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shanghai provinces in the early 1930s as an ornamental garden species (Xu et al.,

Sampling and functional trait measurement To identify occurrence locations of S. canadensis in China and North America, we conducted field surveys in summer and autumn for the period 2013–2016. We sampled a total of 2,051 S. canadensis individuals in 19 native and 61 invasive populations. The number of individuals sampled per population ranged from five to 33. The native range in North America was represented by 577 individuals, while the invaded range in China was represented by 1,474 individuals (Appendix 1). Any two sample populations were at least 5 km apart. In each population, we sampled at random plants that occurred within a radius of 10–20 m to minimize a potential bias due to environmental heterogeneity within a population (e.g., soil moisture and nutrients). To avoid sampling plants from the same genet within the same radius, we sampled plants that were at least two meters apart from each other. For each S . canadensis individual, we took in situ measurements of stem‐base diameter and plant height (in cm). These functional traits are generally linked to ecological strategy axes of plants. As a plant developmental stage (i.e., phenophase) can influence the values of these traits, we took measurements only from mature plants that had set seeds and were therefore presumably not undergoing further development in height and stem diameter. We omitted leaf measurements because an individual S. canadensis plant can have hundreds of leaves (especially in the non‐native range), and hence, finding the largest leaf for measurement can be extremely difficult. In the native range, the ecological niches of S. canadensis and those of its congeners S. gigantea and S. altissima overlap and the three species can coexist (Benelli et al., S. canadensis prefers loose and drier soils than the congeners, and hence, it occurs mostly near urban areas, roadsides, and railways, while the congeners occur mainly on riverside and embankments (Benelli et al., S. canadensis to avoid accidental sampling of the congeners. Moreover, we conducted a test of phylogenetic relatedness among the populations that we sampled in the field to determine whether they all belonged to S. canadensis (see the section on population genetics and phylogenetic analyses below). All the sampled populations in China occurred in a humid subtropical climate except one that occurred in a subtropical highland climate. In contrast, the North American populations were sampled from humid continental, humid subtropical, and semi‐arid climatic zones (Köppen–Geiger climate classification system) (Kottek, Grieser, Beck, Rudolf, & Rube,

Determination of ploidy level We took fresh leaf samples from the same S. canadensis individuals used for functional trait measurements described above. The leaf materials were held in self‐sealing plastic bags containing silica and transported to the laboratory for ploidy level determination. We applied a modified flow cytometry method by Suda and Trávníček ( 2 , 30 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% v/v Triton X‐100, 0.5% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone) in a plastic Petri dish held on a chilled brick. A new razor blade was used for each leaf sample. The resultant fine slurry was filtered through a 600‐mesh nylon filter (Shanghai Aoran Hardware Market, Shanghai, China). The filtrate was held in a new 5‐ml centrifuge tube. The filtered slurry was then resuspended in a pre‐cooled 1 ml of extraction buffer in a Petri dish and then filtered again. The final filtrate was treated with 10 μL/ml of RNase A for 10 min at 4°C. Then, 200 μL/ml of a propidium iodide (PI) staining solution was added and incubated at 4°C for 30 min in darkness. The fluorescence strength of PI‐DNA conjugates was measured on Attune® NxT Acoustic Focusing Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Waltham, MA, USA) using a 488 nm laser and 590/40 emission filter. Leaf of the hexaploid S. canadensis (confirmed by cytometry and karyotype analysis) collected in Taizhou City, Zhejiang Province, China, was used as an external reference.

Statistical analyses To test whether S. canadensis plants from the invaded range had significantly greater height and stem‐base diameter than S. canadensis plants from the native range, we fitted linear mixed‐effect models. In the models, a trait value was treated as a dependent variable, while S. canadensis range (invaded vs. native) was treated as a fixed‐effect independent variable. Population identity of S. canadensis was treated as a random‐effect factor and nested within range. To test whether polyploidy in general conferred higher mean trait values, we also fitted linear mixed‐effect models to test whether the functional trait values differed between hexaploid and diploid individuals in the native range. Because only hexaploids were found in the invaded range, this latter test was not possible for invasive plants. In the test, ploidy level (polyploid vs. diploid) was treated as a fixed‐effect independent variable, while S. canadensis population identity was treated as a random‐effect independent variable. We did additional analyses to test for the potential confounding effect of climate on trait expression by comparing traits of invasive plants with those of native plants from the same climatic zone only. As nearly all invasive plants were sampled in a humid subtropical climate, we used a subset of plants from this climatic zone only. We did separate comparisons for groups of plants that occurred in populations with mixed‐ploidy and for groups of plants that occurred in populations with one ploidy type. Moreover, we compared traits of diploid plants with those of hexaploid plants that occurred in mixed‐ploidy populations only to exclude the potential confounding effect of pure and mixed‐ploidy populations occupying habitats with contrasting ecological conditions. In all the analyses, we fitted the models using maximum likelihood with the lme function in the nlme package (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, & Sarkar, r v 3.5.2 (R Core Team,

Assessing climatic tolerance We described the climatic space occupied by S. canadensis with 19 variables with a 30 arc‐sec resolution (~1 km) derived from the WorldClim database (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, & Jarvis, S. canadensis in China and North America, we collected information on occurrences of S. canadensis provided by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database ( http://www.gbif.org/ ) in order to assess more comprehensively the climatic tolerance of the species.

Occurrences flagged as invalid (e.g., in the oceans) or with doubtful coordinates were removed as well as those separated by less than 30 arc‐seconds to avoid pseudo‐replication. We then extracted values of PC1 and PC2 for each of the 2,214 retained occurrence locations (i.e., our 80 field‐sampled records and 2,134 GBIF records, which included 1,624 records in the native range and 510 records in the invaded range). To test whether climatic space occupied by S. canadensis differed significantly between the invaded and native ranges, we calculated the kernel‐smoothed density of occurrence of the two ranges based on the density of the different combinations of climatic conditions available to each range (Broennimann et al., D metric, which ranges from 0 (no envelope overlap) to 1 (identical envelopes) (Schoener, D value between the two ranges was compared to a null distribution of D values computed between simulated envelopes built through randomization procedures (10,000 randomly selected “background” points generated 100 times).

Comparisons 1 and 2 tested the potential effect of variation in ploidy, while comparisons 3 and 4 tested whether our sampling was representative of the invaded and native ranges. For comparisons 3 and 4, it was not possible to control for variation in ploidy level because information on ploidy level was missing in the GBIF database.

Population genetic and phylogenetic analyses DNA extraction, PCR, and sequencing To estimate gene flow in S. canadensis from North America to China and phylogenetic relationships among the 80 invasive and native populations that we sampled in the field, we sequenced two chloroplast spacer regions ( psbA‐trnH and trnL‐F ) using four universal primer pairs (Appendix 2) (de Andrade et al., 2+ , 4 ng template DNA, 0.15 μM each for forward and reverse primer, 0.3 mM 4 × dNTP mixture, and 1.5 U Taq polymerase (Promega Cooperation, Madison, Wisconsin, USA).

RESULTS Cytobiogeography of S. canadensis  Among all the 80 S. canadensis populations that we sampled in China and North America, all invasive populations had hexaploid individuals (Figure S. canadensis plant (from Bend City population in Oregon State, USA) was tetraploid (Appendix 1). In total, the invasive populations had 1, 474 hexaploid individuals, while the native populations had 414 hexaploid individuals (Appendix 1). There were 162 diploid individuals in the native range (Appendix 1). A map of the sampled populations of Solidago canadensis in parts of its native range in North America (a) and invaded range in China (b). Shown are the distribution of different cytotypes within the populations: Diploids are blue, hexaploids are red, while populations that exhibited mixed‐ploidy are represented by black Functional traits Invasive hexaploids were significantly taller and had a greater stem‐base diameter than native hexaploids (Figure Mean (±1SE) height and stem‐base diameter of Solidago canadensis plants. Shown are comparisons between invasive hexaploids and native hexaploids (a & b), and between native diploids and native hexaploids (c & d) Climatic envelopes of S. canadensis  The PCA revealed two principal components that cumulatively explained 74% of variation in the climatic data (Figure S. canadensis was neither significantly equivalent ( p = 1.00) nor similar ( p > 0.14) (Table p = 0.92 along PC1 and p = 0.46 along PC2) (Table p = 0.74 along PC1 and p = 0.75 along PC2) (Table D = 0.78; equivalency test; p = 0.02; Appendix 4).

For variable abbreviations, see Hijmans et al. ( S. canadensis from China, while red circles represent S. canadensis populations from the native range in North America Results of climatic envelope analysis for invasive and native populations of Solidago canadensis . The comparison “ Invasive versus native hexaploids ” compares Chinese hexaploid with North American hexaploid populations; “ Among samples ” compares variation among our field‐sampled populations in China and North America pooled together (80 populations); “ China versus Native range ” compares occurrences in China with North America and Mexico (our field‐sampled sites and GBIF records); “ Entire invaded range versus Native range ” compares occurrences in entire invaded range in China, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan with North America and Mexico (our field‐sampled sites and GBIF records). The last three comparisons did not control for a variation in ploidy level. The column “ D ” refers to the value of the Schoener's D metric, “ Equivalency ” to the P value of the equivalency test, “ Similarity ” to the P value of the similarity test, and “ Breadth ratio ” to the ratio between the environmental tolerance of native populations to that of invasive populations along the axes PC1 and PC2 (when a significant difference in environmental tolerance was found).

On the other hand, plant height had significant positive correlations with six (annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, temperature seasonality, mean temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of coldest quarter) and significant negative correlations with four (isothermality, minimum temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of warmest quarter, and precipitation of wettest quarter) bioclimatic variables (Appendix 5). Genetic diversity of S. canadensis in the invaded and native ranges We found a total of 34 haplotypes from 536 sequences (289 sequences for invasive populations vs. 247 sequences for native populations) based on the two chloroplast spacer regions ( psbA‐trnH and trnL‐F ) (Appendix 6). The native range harbored 32 of the haplotypes, while the invaded range harbored five of the haplotypes. Haplotype H1 was the most abundant and widely distributed as it occurred in all the invasive populations and in 75% of the native populations (Appendix 6). Two other haplotypes (H9 and H11) occurred in both invaded and native ranges. The rest of the haplotypes were private, as they occurred exclusively in the invaded (H32 and H34) and native (H2‐H8, H10, H12‐H31, and H33) ranges (Appendix 6). A geographic structure in the distribution of the haplotypes is also reflected in the haplotype network, which did not have a perfect star‐like pattern in the analysis using a combined data set of invasive and native haplotypes (Appendix 7) and separate analyses for the two sets of haplotypes (results not shown). The invasive populations had a significantly lower mean number of polymorphic sites and haplotypes per population than native populations (Table Results of linear mixed‐effect models to test whether mean population genetic diversity indices (number of polymorphic sites, mean number of haplotypes per population, haplotypic diversity ( Hd ), and nucleotide diversity ( n )) differed significantly between invasive and native populations of Solidago canadensis .

Cytobiogeography of S. canadensis  Among all the 80 S. canadensis populations that we sampled in China and North America, all invasive populations had hexaploid individuals (Figure S. canadensis plant (from Bend City population in Oregon State, USA) was tetraploid (Appendix 1). In total, the invasive populations had 1, 474 hexaploid individuals, while the native populations had 414 hexaploid individuals (Appendix 1). There were 162 diploid individuals in the native range (Appendix 1). A map of the sampled populations of Solidago canadensis in parts of its native range in North America (a) and invaded range in China (b). Shown are the distribution of different cytotypes within the populations: Diploids are blue, hexaploids are red, while populations that exhibited mixed‐ploidy are represented by black

Functional traits Invasive hexaploids were significantly taller and had a greater stem‐base diameter than native hexaploids (Figure Mean (±1SE) height and stem‐base diameter of Solidago canadensis plants. Shown are comparisons between invasive hexaploids and native hexaploids (a & b), and between native diploids and native hexaploids (c & d)

Climatic envelopes of S. canadensis  The PCA revealed two principal components that cumulatively explained 74% of variation in the climatic data (Figure S. canadensis was neither significantly equivalent ( p = 1.00) nor similar ( p > 0.14) (Table p = 0.92 along PC1 and p = 0.46 along PC2) (Table p = 0.74 along PC1 and p = 0.75 along PC2) (Table D = 0.78; equivalency test; p = 0.02; Appendix 4).

Correlations between plant traits and bioclimatic variables Stem‐base diameter had significant positive correlations with five (annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, precipitation of the driest quarter, precipitation of the warmest quarter, and precipitation of the coldest quarter) and significant negative correlations with another five (isothermality, maximum temperature of warmest month, annual precipitation, precipitation of driest month, and precipitation of wettest quarter) bioclimatic variables (Appendix 5). On the other hand, plant height had significant positive correlations with six (annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, temperature seasonality, mean temperature of coldest quarter, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of coldest quarter) and significant negative correlations with four (isothermality, minimum temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of warmest quarter, and precipitation of wettest quarter) bioclimatic variables (Appendix 5).

Genetic diversity of S. canadensis in the invaded and native ranges We found a total of 34 haplotypes from 536 sequences (289 sequences for invasive populations vs. 247 sequences for native populations) based on the two chloroplast spacer regions ( psbA‐trnH and trnL‐F ) (Appendix 6). The native range harbored 32 of the haplotypes, while the invaded range harbored five of the haplotypes. Haplotype H1 was the most abundant and widely distributed as it occurred in all the invasive populations and in 75% of the native populations (Appendix 6). Two other haplotypes (H9 and H11) occurred in both invaded and native ranges. The rest of the haplotypes were private, as they occurred exclusively in the invaded (H32 and H34) and native (H2‐H8, H10, H12‐H31, and H33) ranges (Appendix 6). A geographic structure in the distribution of the haplotypes is also reflected in the haplotype network, which did not have a perfect star‐like pattern in the analysis using a combined data set of invasive and native haplotypes (Appendix 7) and separate analyses for the two sets of haplotypes (results not shown). The invasive populations had a significantly lower mean number of polymorphic sites and haplotypes per population than native populations (Table Results of linear mixed‐effect models to test whether mean population genetic diversity indices (number of polymorphic sites, mean number of haplotypes per population, haplotypic diversity ( Hd ), and nucleotide diversity ( n )) differed significantly between invasive and native populations of Solidago canadensis .

Genetic structure and phylogenetic relatedness We detected significant genetic structures at all hierarchical levels (Table F  ST = 0.523) than in China ( F  ST = 0.329) (Table F test statistic (Fu's S F = −4.905; S p = 0.007), while Tajima's D test statistic did not provide support (Tajima's D = −1.46; p > 0.1).

DISCUSSION The present study used S. canadensis to test whether invasive populations had a higher proportion of polyploids, were significantly larger, and occupied a wider range of climatic conditions than conspecific native‐range populations. Because biogeographic differences between invasive and native populations in cytotype frequency and functional traits could be due to stochastic founder events, the study also tested whether the invasive populations had overcome (or minimized) founder effects. We found that all invasive S. canadensis populations sampled in China were purely hexaploid, while the native populations sampled in North America were diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid. The invasive hexaploids were significantly taller and had a  larger stem‐base diameter than native hexaploids. Within the native range, hexaploid S. canadensis plants were significantly taller and had a larger stem‐base diameter than conspecific diploids. Climatic envelope assessment found that invasive and native populations occupied different climatic conditions, with invasive populations occurring in warmer and less seasonal climates than native populations. However, there was no significant correlation between ploidy level and the climatic envelope of S. canadensis , at least along the two axes of the PCA that cumulatively explained 74% of variation in climate. Our results are robust to a sampling bias because two comparisons involving a global data set of S. canadensis occurrence records versus a part of invaded range in China and the global data set versus the entire invaded range produced similar results (Table S. canadensis and that other factors may determine its invasiveness in China. Climatic envelopes of Solidago canadensis in its native (orange) and invaded (blue) ranges. The following comparisons were made: (a) invasive hexaploid versus native hexaploid populations; (b) all invasive versus native populations that we sampled in the field without controlling for variation in ploidy; (c) all occurrences in North America and Mexico (our field‐sampled sites and GBIF records) versus China; (d) all occurrences in North America and Mexico versus entire invaded range in China, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Histograms on top and on the right side of each figure give the standardized density distribution along the first (PC1) and second (PC2) principal components, respectively Cytobiogeography and functional trait differences The present findings that invasive S. canadensis populations in China were comprised only of hexaploid individuals, while native populations in North America were diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid, could be explained by three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses. First, it is plausible that only hexaploid plants were able to adapt to new conditions after introduction and compete with native species, while other cytotypes failed. Second, because S. canadensis was introduced to China as an ornamental garden plant (Xu et al., The present finding that invasive S. canadensis hexaploids had greater height and stem‐base diameter than native hexaploids (Figure Oxalis pes‐caprae tetraploids produced more aboveground biomass and offspring bulbs than native O. pes‐caprae tetraploids (Tavares et al., S. gigantea , invasive tetraploids produced more biomass than native‐range hexaploids (Nagy et al., C. stoebe had similar length and number of florets, length of capitula and longest branch, leaf weight and leaf area as conspecific native tetraploids (Mráz, Vicia cracca , invasive tetraploids had greater seedling height and aboveground biomass than native tetraploids; however, the two groups of plants produced similar numbers of seeds and branches (Líblová, Eliášová, & Münzbergová, S. canadensis and combine manipulative common‐garden experiments with cytobiogeography and molecular phylogeography are required to more rigorously test whether divergence in ploidy levels and functional traits between ranges could be due to natural selection. No correlation between ploidy level and climatic envelope of S. canadensis  The invasive S. canadensis populations occupied a novel climatic envelope (i.e., there was no significant envelope overlap with native S. canadensis ) and exhibited a contraction in climatic tolerance (i.e., occurred in warmer and less seasonal climates) relative to native S. canadensis populations independent of variation in ploidy level (Table S. canadensis populations occurred in similar climatic conditions. While our sampling of S. canadensis cytotype distribution was limited to only parts of the invaded (China) and native (North America) ranges, with the invaded range dominated by one climatic zone, the present results suggest that polyploidy does not influence S. canadensis climatic tolerance. Future studies that cover the entire climatic ranges of the species are required to validate our findings. Population demographic expansions in both ranges Results of Tajima's D and Fu's F neutrality tests suggest that either purifying selection acted on the S S. canadensis populations or the populations experienced recent demographic expansions. However, because the two chloroplast spacer regions ( psbA‐trnH and trnL‐F ) are non‐coding loci and are thus unlikely to be under selection, these results more likely indicate population demographic expansions. Although the Fu's F neutrality test was significant for invasive populations, while Tajima's S D was not, it has been shown that Fu's F test is more powerful than Tajima's S D (Ramos‐Onsins & Rozas, Signatures of reduced genetic founder effects in the invaded range The finding that invasive populations had significantly lower mean number of polymorphic sites and haplotypes than native populations (Table S. canadensis has been present in China for at least 80 years, it is plausible that over multiple generations, mutations increased genetic diversity in the invaded range. All sampled populations belonged to S. canadensis  Although the ecological envelope of S. canadensis can overlap with that of its congeners like S. gigantea and S. altissima in the native range, our analysis of phylogenetic relatedness among the study populations did not reveal any clear pattern of clade formation (i.e., all populations were monophyletic; Appendices 9–11). Thus, it is highly likely that the invasive and native populations that we sampled in the field all belonged to S. canadensis .

Thus, it is highly likely that the invasive and native populations that we sampled in the field all belonged to S. canadensis .

CONCLUSION Our results suggest that polyploidy does not influence climatic tolerance of S. canadensis in its invaded and native ranges. While a caveat exists for our study because our sampling of S. canadensis cytobiogeography did not cover its entire invaded and native ranges, the results instead indicate that unknown genetic and environmental factors may influence S. canadensis climatic tolerance. Our results provide a useful first step to comprehensively test whether polyploidy influences climatic envelope of S. canadensis . For S. canadensis , effects of polyploidy at molecular and nuclear levels have not been investigated and would be a first step in determining how genetic changes scale up to physiological processes and ultimately biogeographic distribution patterns. Therefore, future mechanistic studies should couple cytobiogeographical and molecular phylogeography approaches with functional genomic approaches that document gene expression patterns under different ecological conditions. In addition, experimental studies such as multisite common‐garden and reciprocal transplants in both invaded and native ranges will be required.

10.1002_ece3.6784,"Abstract Frogs and toads (Lissamphibia: Anura) show a diversity of locomotor modes that allow them to inhabit a wide range of habitats. The different locomotor modes are likely to be linked to anatomical specializations of the skeleton within the typical frog Bauplan. While such anatomical adaptations of the hind limbs and the pelvic girdle are comparably well understood, the pectoral girdle received much less attention in the past. We tested for locomotor‐mode‐related shape differences in the pectoral girdle bones of 64 anuran species by means of micro‐computed‐tomography‐based geometric morphometrics. The pectoral girdles of selected species were analyzed with regard to the effects of shape differences on muscle moment arms across the shoulder joint and stress dissipation within the coracoid. Phylogenetic relationships, size, and locomotor behavior have an effect on the shape of the pectoral girdle in anurans, but there are differences in the relative impact of these factors between the bones of this skeletal unit. Remarkable shape diversity has been observed within locomotor groups indicating many‐to‐one mapping of form onto function. Significant shape differences have mainly been related to the overall pectoral girdle geometry and the shape of the coracoid. Most prominent shape differences have been found between burrowing and nonburrowing species with headfirst and backward burrowing species significantly differing from one another and from the other locomotor groups. The pectoral girdle shapes of burrowing species have generally larger moment arms for (simulated) humerus retractor muscles across the shoulder joint, which might be an adaptation to the burrowing behavior. The mechanisms of how the moment arms were enlarged differed between species and were associated with differences in the reaction of the coracoid to simulated loading by physiologically relevant forces.","INTRODUCTION Frogs and toads (Lissamphibia: Anura) inhabit a wide range of habitats and, among other things, utilize different locomotor behaviors within those habitats (Wells, From an ecomorphological point of view, different behaviors and the associated performances provide the link between the morphology of a specimen and its ecology (e.g., Arnold, Previous studies (e.g., Citadini, Brandt, Williams, & Gomes, High jumping performance, for instance, was generally associated with relatively short forelimbs (Zug, In addition, previously recognized morphological adaptations to swimming involved specific relative limb proportions (Gómez & Lires, Xenupus laevis allowed for sliding and was thought to thereby increase the length of the power stroke and to contribute to fast submerging after breathing (Videler & Jorna, Climbing behavior was usually associated with a bicondylar sacro‐urostylic articulation (Reilly & Jorgensen, Finally, the body of burrowing species was generally observed to be globular (Dutta & Pradhan, The forelimbs of anurans have been reported to accomplish species‐ and case‐specific tasks during locomotion (e.g., hopping/jumping: Nauwelaerts & Aerts, Different pectoral girdle types (arciferal, firmisternal) were suggested to accomplish similar tasks (i.e., dissipating landing forces), but in different ways (Emerson, Here, we aim to resolve the relationships between locomotor mode, shape variation, and biomechanical function of the pectoral girdle of anurans. To do so, selected anuran species were assigned to one of six groups of locomotor behavior (subsequently called locomotor groups) and the shape of their pectoral girdle bones was assessed by means of geometric morphometrics. The phylogenetic signal was determined, and shape differences among locomotor groups were statistically assessed. The pectoral girdles of selected species were analyzed with regard to the effects of shape differences on muscle moment arms across the shoulder joint and simulated stress dissipation within the coracoid. Results were discussed in the context of adaptation to locomotor behaviors.

The mean gray value m was used to set limits to the gray value histogram of the respective CT volume in Fiji (based on ImageJ 1.51n; Schindelin et al., m − 462.812 (see Each adjusted CT volume was resliced from top to bottom and from left to right, and all stacks were thresholded by automatic local thresholding (Fiji plugin Auto Local Threshold , Landini, Rueden, Schindelin, Hiner, & Helfrich, https://imagej.net/Auto_Local_Threshold ). The three thresholding results of each CT volume were combined in Amira by setting those voxels as bone that were classified as bone in any two of the three thresholded stacks. The resulting stack was combined with the rough segmentation of the pectoral girdle bones to separate the bones form other structures. Foramina were filled and artifacts (i.e., segmented noise, unsegmented bone voxels) were corrected in regions in which semilandmarks should be placed by manually adjusting the segmentation accordingly. Polygon surfaces were generated using the Generate Lego Surface module in Amira in combination with surface simplification (reduction of polygon count and smoothing; Simplification Editor and Smooth Surface module) to a subjective optimal degree. Surface generation and simplification were accelerated by a modified version of the MultiExport macro (Engelkes, Friedrich, Hammel, & Haas, Landmarks and superimposition Landmarks were, with slight modifications, adopted from Engelkes et al. ( Kaloula pulchra , Microhyla nepenthicola , and M. pulchra ) lacked a clavicula and, consequently, the (semi)landmarks on the clavicula were missing in the respective landmark configurations. Landmarks (pink; L1‐19) and semilandmarks (violet; C1‐9) on the bones of the left‐side pectoral girdle of Ecnomiohyla miliaria . (a) Lateral view. (b) Medial view All subsequent steps were performed in R (version 3.5.3; R Core Team, estimate.missing ) to allow for the incomplete landmark sets being analyzed together with the others. The following five subsets of (semi)landmarks were defined: all fixed landmarks (including start and endpoints of curves) to analyze the overall geometry of the pectoral girdle, and all landmarks and semilandmarks of a given pectoral girdle bone to allow for a more detailed shape comparison. Species lacking a clavicula were excluded from the subset consisting of (semi)landmarks on the clavicula. The following steps were performed for the full landmark sets and for each subset separately. All landmark sets of a given species were superimposed using a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA; gpagen, if applicable, including sliding of semilandmarks to minimize bending energy), rescaled to their original centroid size and the species mean shape was calculated ( mshape ). A GPA (including sliding of semilandmarks to minimize bending energy, if applicable) was performed to superimpose the species mean shapes. The resulting sets of superimposed species mean shapes will subsequently be referred to as full landmark dataset and landmark datasets i through v, with the full dataset consisting of all landmarks and semilandmarks, landmark datasets i denoting the set of fixed landmarks and ii‐v denoting the sets comprising all landmarks and semilandmarks, respectively, on the scapula, coracoid, cleithrum, or clavicula. Statistical analyses and visualization The full landmark dataset was used to assess the modularity (sensu Schlosser, phylo.modularity ; Adams, The following analyses were performed for each set of superimposed species mean shapes (landmark datasets i–v) separately. The phylogenetic signal in the landmark data was assessed using a multivariate version of the K‐statistic with the statistical significance being determined by 1,000 random permutations ( physignal ; Adams, procD.pgls ) were performed to test for significant differences between the mean shapes of locomotor groups. Potential effects of specimen size on shape were accounted for by incorporating the log‐transformed centroid size and its interaction with mode of locomotion in the pMANOVAs. If there were statistically significant differences, pairwise comparisons of the mean shape between locomotor groups were performed while accounting for size ( pairwise ; null model: coords ~ logCS , where coords denotes one of landmark datasets i–v and logCS the log‐transformed centroid size). Statistical significance was assessed by 1,000 permutations in pMANOVAs and pairwise comparisons; p ‐values below .05 were considered significant in all tests. Principal component analyses (PCAs; gm.prcomp ) were separately performed for landmark datasets i–v to visualize the distribution of species mean shapes in morphospace ( plot , shapeHulls ).

All commonly scaled and orientated surfaces were equipped with the same simplified humerus in order to exclude any potential effects of the humerus shape on muscle moment arms. The shoulder joint was defined with two axes of rotation: one allowing adduction and abduction, and one allowing protraction and retraction. The humerus being aligned with the x ‐axis (perpendicular to the sagittal [ y ‐ z ] plane) was used as reference position for angular measurements. Previous studies (e.g., Bigalke, Finite element analysis of coracoids The species close to the extreme ends of the first two principal components and a species close to the mean shape in the landmark dataset of species mean coracoid shapes (iii) were chosen to assess the effects of different loading conditions by using finite element analyses. The coracoid surfaces were extracted from the corresponding surfaces used for musculoskeletal modeling. As a consequence of this approach, all coracoids were scaled and orientated in a way that reflected the actual conditions in the specimens and they were modeled as solid structures. Neglecting inner structures was expected to have a minor effect base on the observations of Mielke and Nyakatura ( Hemisus marmoratus was fused to other bones; those bones were manually removed (MODO).

Segmentation and surface generation A previous study (Engelkes et al., m of pectoral girdle bones and surrounding soft tissues, and the standard deviation of the soft tissue gray values were determined for each original CT volume separately. The mean gray value m was used to set limits to the gray value histogram of the respective CT volume in Fiji (based on ImageJ 1.51n; Schindelin et al., m − 462.812 (see Each adjusted CT volume was resliced from top to bottom and from left to right, and all stacks were thresholded by automatic local thresholding (Fiji plugin Auto Local Threshold , Landini, Rueden, Schindelin, Hiner, & Helfrich, https://imagej.net/Auto_Local_Threshold ). The three thresholding results of each CT volume were combined in Amira by setting those voxels as bone that were classified as bone in any two of the three thresholded stacks. The resulting stack was combined with the rough segmentation of the pectoral girdle bones to separate the bones form other structures. Foramina were filled and artifacts (i.e., segmented noise, unsegmented bone voxels) were corrected in regions in which semilandmarks should be placed by manually adjusting the segmentation accordingly. Polygon surfaces were generated using the Generate Lego Surface module in Amira in combination with surface simplification (reduction of polygon count and smoothing; Simplification Editor and Smooth Surface module) to a subjective optimal degree. Surface generation and simplification were accelerated by a modified version of the MultiExport macro (Engelkes, Friedrich, Hammel, & Haas,

Landmarks and superimposition Landmarks were, with slight modifications, adopted from Engelkes et al. ( Kaloula pulchra , Microhyla nepenthicola , and M. pulchra ) lacked a clavicula and, consequently, the (semi)landmarks on the clavicula were missing in the respective landmark configurations. Landmarks (pink; L1‐19) and semilandmarks (violet; C1‐9) on the bones of the left‐side pectoral girdle of Ecnomiohyla miliaria . (a) Lateral view. (b) Medial view All subsequent steps were performed in R (version 3.5.3; R Core Team, estimate.missing ) to allow for the incomplete landmark sets being analyzed together with the others. The following five subsets of (semi)landmarks were defined: all fixed landmarks (including start and endpoints of curves) to analyze the overall geometry of the pectoral girdle, and all landmarks and semilandmarks of a given pectoral girdle bone to allow for a more detailed shape comparison. Species lacking a clavicula were excluded from the subset consisting of (semi)landmarks on the clavicula. The following steps were performed for the full landmark sets and for each subset separately. All landmark sets of a given species were superimposed using a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA; gpagen, if applicable, including sliding of semilandmarks to minimize bending energy), rescaled to their original centroid size and the species mean shape was calculated ( mshape ). A GPA (including sliding of semilandmarks to minimize bending energy, if applicable) was performed to superimpose the species mean shapes. The resulting sets of superimposed species mean shapes will subsequently be referred to as full landmark dataset and landmark datasets i through v, with the full dataset consisting of all landmarks and semilandmarks, landmark datasets i denoting the set of fixed landmarks and ii‐v denoting the sets comprising all landmarks and semilandmarks, respectively, on the scapula, coracoid, cleithrum, or clavicula.

Statistical analyses and visualization The full landmark dataset was used to assess the modularity (sensu Schlosser, phylo.modularity ; Adams, The following analyses were performed for each set of superimposed species mean shapes (landmark datasets i–v) separately. The phylogenetic signal in the landmark data was assessed using a multivariate version of the K‐statistic with the statistical significance being determined by 1,000 random permutations ( physignal ; Adams, procD.pgls ) were performed to test for significant differences between the mean shapes of locomotor groups. Potential effects of specimen size on shape were accounted for by incorporating the log‐transformed centroid size and its interaction with mode of locomotion in the pMANOVAs. If there were statistically significant differences, pairwise comparisons of the mean shape between locomotor groups were performed while accounting for size ( pairwise ; null model: coords ~ logCS , where coords denotes one of landmark datasets i–v and logCS the log‐transformed centroid size). Statistical significance was assessed by 1,000 permutations in pMANOVAs and pairwise comparisons; p ‐values below .05 were considered significant in all tests. Principal component analyses (PCAs; gm.prcomp ) were separately performed for landmark datasets i–v to visualize the distribution of species mean shapes in morphospace ( plot , shapeHulls ). For the dataset of fixed landmarks only (i), all individual landmark configurations belonging to a given species were transformed as their respective mean shape had been transformed during GPA and PCA (details in Engelkes et al., evplot function published with Borcard, Gillet, & Legendre,

RESULTS Overall shape of pectoral girdle bones The first five principal components (PCs) of the species mean shapes of the overall geometry of the pectoral girdle bones (landmark dataset i) were significant and, respectively, represented 48.62%, 14.42%, 8.5%, 5.62%, and 5.1% of the variance in the landmark data. The pectoral girdle shapes of swimming and climbing species, and those of swimming and backward burrowing species differed with regard to the shape differences associated with PC 1 (Figure Principal component (PC) plot of overall species mean shapes of pectoral girdle bones (landmark dataset i) and surfaces of selected specimens. (a) PC plot of species mean shapes. Gray points illustrate single landmark configurations used to calculate the species mean shapes. (b) Surfaces of the left‐side pectoral girdles used for musculoskeletal modeling; sternal and episternal elements omitted The first principal component was mainly associated with differences in the height (dorsal–ventral expansion) of the scapula relative to its width (anterior–posterior expansion) and to the length of the clavicula and coracoid, the position of the glenoid cavity relative to the dorsal margin of the scapula and the ventral midline, as well as the angles of the clavicula and coracoid relative to each other and to the ventral midline. A high scapula was generally associated with a more medially located glenoid cavity and with comparably short clavicula and coracoid; the long axes of the ventral bones lay approximately parallel to each other and rather perpendicular to the ventral midline of the specimen. If a flat scapula was present, the ventral bones were angled such that their long axes diverged medially. The clavicula was curved, and the anterior and posterior margins of the coracoid were comparably straight (inferred from exemplary pectoral girdles shown in Figure The phylogenetic signal ( K  mult = 0.9595; p = .001) and the effects of the log‐transformed centroid size and locomotor mode on shape were statistically significant (Table R  2 = 0.19483) accounted for considerably more of the shape variation than the log‐transformed centroid size ( R  2 = 0.05260). The pairwise comparison of mean shapes of locomotor groups revealed that climbing species significantly differed from swimming species, that the group of backward burrowing species significantly differed from headfirst burrowing species, and that each burrowing group significantly differed from all other locomotor groups, except for headfirst burrowers that did not differ from swimmers (Table Results of pMANOVA of species mean shapes of pectoral girdle bones performed for fixed landmarks only (landmark dataset i)  Df  SS MS  R  2   F   p  Log. centroid size 1 0.0013047 0.00130473 0.05260 4.2706 .001* Locomotor mode 5 0.0048325 0.00096649 0.19483 3.1635 .001* Log. centroid size:locomotor mode 5 0.0017934 0.00035867 0.07230 1.1740 .234 Residuals 52 0.0158866 0.00030551 0.64052 Total 63 0.0248028 Note Asterisks (*) denote statistical significance.

Headfirst burrowing and swimming species differed from backward burrowing species along the first two PCs. There was no specific pattern with regard to group‐related shape differences along PC 3.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd Shapes of the cleithrum and clavicula There were significant phylogenetic signals in the species mean shapes of the cleithrum (landmark dataset iv; K  mult = 0.5113; p = .001) and the clavicula (landmark dataset v; K  mult = 0.8752; p = .001). The pMANOVAs revealed no significant effects of locomotor group or log‐transformed centroid size and the principal components showed no clear pattern of separation of locomotor groups for any of the two landmark datasets (iv, v), although the first three (iv) or four (v) PCs were significant. Muscle moment arms The moment arms (Figure Sphaerotheca breviceps which showed comparably small moment arms for the posterior muscle during retraction and had a relatively small range of humerus positions in which this muscle contributed to retraction. The sternal muscle in this species, however, showed similar properties as the posterior muscles in the other burrowing species. The properties of the other muscles showed no clear pattern of association with locomotor groups. Similar to the sternal muscle, the existence of a episternal muscle (if present) increased the moment arm for humerus protraction and widened the range of humerus positions for which the muscles contributed to protraction if compared to the anterior muscle of the respective species. Finite element analysis of coracoids Within each species, lowest mesh‐weighted arithmetic mean (mwam) von Mises stresses were observed if the coracoid was loaded along its long axis (scenario I; Figure Breviceps mossambicus experienced lowest mwam von Mises stresses under all loading scenarios. The coracoid of Hemisus marmoratus experienced highest mwam von Mises stresses under loading through the shoulder joint in lateromedial direction (scenario II) or by the hypothetical action of the posterior muscle (scenario III).

Shapes of the cleithrum and clavicula There were significant phylogenetic signals in the species mean shapes of the cleithrum (landmark dataset iv; K  mult = 0.5113; p = .001) and the clavicula (landmark dataset v; K  mult = 0.8752; p = .001). The pMANOVAs revealed no significant effects of locomotor group or log‐transformed centroid size and the principal components showed no clear pattern of separation of locomotor groups for any of the two landmark datasets (iv, v), although the first three (iv) or four (v) PCs were significant.

Muscle moment arms The moment arms (Figure Sphaerotheca breviceps which showed comparably small moment arms for the posterior muscle during retraction and had a relatively small range of humerus positions in which this muscle contributed to retraction. The sternal muscle in this species, however, showed similar properties as the posterior muscles in the other burrowing species. The properties of the other muscles showed no clear pattern of association with locomotor groups. Similar to the sternal muscle, the existence of a episternal muscle (if present) increased the moment arm for humerus protraction and widened the range of humerus positions for which the muscles contributed to protraction if compared to the anterior muscle of the respective species.

Finite element analysis of coracoids Within each species, lowest mesh‐weighted arithmetic mean (mwam) von Mises stresses were observed if the coracoid was loaded along its long axis (scenario I; Figure Breviceps mossambicus experienced lowest mwam von Mises stresses under all loading scenarios. The coracoid of Hemisus marmoratus experienced highest mwam von Mises stresses under loading through the shoulder joint in lateromedial direction (scenario II) or by the hypothetical action of the posterior muscle (scenario III).

DISCUSSION Our data indicate that the phylogenetic history, the size, and the locomotor behavior have significant effects on the shape of the pectoral girdle bones of anurans but the relative impact of these factors differs between bones. The most striking locomotor‐behavior‐related shape differences were observed between burrowing and nonburrowing species; those differences might be explained by a functional adaptation to the burrowing behavior and are possibly associated with trade‐offs. The shapes of the other locomotor groups differed less or even not at all and most groups showed remarkable within‐group shape diversity. Similarly shaped pectoral girdles provide the anatomical base for different locomotor behaviors, which indicates that the processes of many‐to‐one mapping (i.e., different morphologies can result in the same functional performance which might lead to a partial decoupling of morphological characters and function; Wainwright, Alfaro, Bolnick, & Hulsey, Modularity and phylogenetic signal The observed differences in the relative impact of the considered factors (phylogeny, size, locomotion) on the shape of the distinct pectoral girdle bones might indicate some modularity within the pectoral girdle of anurans. This is supported by the statistical significance of the modularity test, although the result of this test should be interpreted with caution, as the test was performed on fixed landmarks and semilandmarks (Cardini, At least some anatomical traits of anurans are influenced by their phylogenetic history; among these traits are the absolute and relative length of the hind limbs (Gomes, Rezende, Grizante, & Navas, K . The species mean shapes of the scapulae resembled each other more than expected under a Brownian motion model ( mult K  mult > 1), which implies that the phylogenetic history is the major factor in the evolution of the scapula shape. This is also supported by the observed differences in the shapes of the scapulae of non‐neobatrachian and neobatrachian species (Figures K  mult < 1). This indicates that other factors (i.e., locomotion) besides phylogeny influence the evolution of the coracoid shape. Among the factors considered herein, the phylogenetic relation seems to be the only factor to determine the shapes of the cleithrum and clavicula as the statistical analyses were insignificant for the factors size and locomotor group. But this might be an artifact caused by the GPA or pMANOVA, as the shape of each of these bones was analyzed using one curve of more or less colinear semilandmarks only. There might be an association of the shape of these bones with size or locomotion that was not detected by our analyses. These observations allow the hypothesis that the evolution of the shape of the distinct pectoral girdle bones is driven by different primary factors, although they are part of the same complex. If so, this could indicate differences in the functional importance of these bones. Adaptation of pectoral girdle shape to burrowing behavior The most striking differences in the pectoral girdle shape were observed between burrowing and nonburrowing species (Figures Emerson ( Hemisus marmoratus moved the soil by forelimb retraction and that this motion was accompanied by a lateral force component. She assumed the enlarged retractor muscles and the elongated, posteriorly angled coracoids found in this species to be adaptations to the headfirst burrowing behavior. Our results indicate additional effects of the shape and orientation of the coracoid: The specific configuration of the coracoid shifted the origin of the posterior muscle backwards and thereby increased its moment arm across the shoulder joint, that is, its effectiveness (Sherman, Seth, & Delp, H. marmoratus . The finite element analyses revealed that the coracoid of H. marmoratus experienced comparable high mesh‐weighted arithmetic mean von Mises stresses if loading by the posterior muscle (scenario III) or by mediolateral compression (scenario II) was simulated (Figure With regard to the pectoral girdle resisting to medially directed compression, it is noteworthy that the clavicula in H. marmoratus is angled rather perpendicular to the ventral midline, more robust, and enlarged medially (Figure H. marmoratus , the clavicula replaces the coracoid, for example, in transmitting and dissipating medially directed compressive forces through the shoulder joint. If this was true and the clavicula resisted most of the forces imposed by a medially directed compression, the mediolateral bending of the coracoid would be considerably reduced, which in turn would have led to smaller von Mises stresses in the coracoid. Such an effect was not observed in our simulations as we artificially removed the clavicula and the scapula, but the fusion of these two bones to the coracoid (Figure The specific clavicula configuration observed in H. marmoratus results in a small moment arm for the anterior muscle (Figure H. marmoratus might have evolved to compensate for this disadvantage by expanding the area for muscle attachment anteriorly, which in turn leads to a larger moment arm across the shoulder joint (see episternal muscle in Figure Large moment arms for the humerus retractor muscles seem to be a requirement for backward burrowing, too (compare Figure It is remarkable that the coracoid of Breviceps mossambicus experienced lowest von Mises stresses in the finite element analyses (Figure B. mossambicus and comes at the cost of a small moment arm of the posterior muscle with regard to humerus retraction (Figure H. marmoratus (and other species), the pars ossea of the sternum in B. mossambicus might have evolved to compensate for this presumably disadvantageous moment arm (also compare Trueb, Two further observations support the hypothesis that the pectoral girdles of different species are adapted to their burrowing: Alytes cisternasii has been reported to be the faster and more efficient headfirst burrower if compared to the also headfirst burrowing A. obstetricans (Brown & Crespo, A. obstetricans being within the range of walking, hopping and jumping species, whereas the shape of A. cisternasii more resembles that of other headfirst burrowing species (Figure A. cisternasii might allow this species to perform better in burrowing. Despite the significant phylogenetic signal, the shape differences in the pectoral girdles of the jumping species Pseudacris triseriata and the headfirst burrowing species P. streckeri are comparably large with the latter more closely resembling the shape of other burrowing species (Figure Walking, hopping, and jumping In contrast to previous studies (see introduction for a summary), our analyses indicate that there is no specific pectoral girdle shape associated with either of these locomotor modes (Table Swimming and climbing Swimming species significantly differed from headfirst burrowing species, as well as climbing from jumping species in the mean shapes of the scapulae only. These differences, although observed in the context of locomotor behavior, could be caused by the phylogenetic structure of the respective locomotor groups: The group of swimming species consisted of mostly non‐neobatrachians whereas the group of headfirst burrowing species consisted of non‐neobatrachians and neobatrachians (Figure The potential lack of a specific pectoral girdle shape within aquatic species might be explained by the fact that most anurans are good swimmers and likely have pectoral girdles that allow for an efficient aquatic locomotion. If so, the pectoral girdle shape of purely aquatic species would not differ much from nonaquatic species. An additional explanation for the nonspecific pectoral girdle shape of swimming anurans might be that the forelimbs are involved in swimming to only a minor extent (Abourachid & Green, Following the lines of argumentation above, it might be possible that there is no locomotor‐behavior‐related shape difference between jumping and climbing species, as the latter group consisted of neobatrachian species only, whereas the former additionally contained non‐neobatrachians. It is noteworthy that climbing evolved several times independently within the Neobatrachia only (Reilly & Jorgensen, Ascaphus truei , Alytes obstetricans , and Scaphiopus holbrookii (Noble & Jaeckle, Many‐to‐one mapping and trade‐offs The locomotor groups in our study showed a remarkable within‐group pectoral girdle shape diversity (Figures We observed few, if any, significant shape differences between swimming, jumping, climbing and walking, hopping species, and large regions of overlap of locomotor groups in morphospace (Figures Both, many‐to‐one mapping and trade‐offs, might have occurred during the evolution of the morphological diversity in anurans. For example, Moen ( Potentially undetected adaptation of pectoral girdle shape to function Despite our observations, there might be some functional adaptation of the pectoral girdle shape to more specific motion patterns than implied by our coarse definitions of walking, hopping, jumping, swimming, and climbing. Following Emerson ( The forelimbs of anurans are involved in other species‐specific behaviors besides locomotion as, for example, prey manipulation (Gray, O’Reilly, & Nishikawa, The literature record on anuran behavior and our definition of locomotor groups might be insufficient to fully represent the behavior of at least some species. For example, the backward burrowing species Rhinophrynus dorsalis is hypothesized to be capable of headfirst burrowing (Trueb & Gans, Aplastodiscus leucopygius is an arboreal species (Ferreira et al., Limitations and future perspectives Most anuran species in our sample were represented by one specimen only, and shape analyses were performed on the mean shapes of species. We did not consider sexual dimorphism, although this phenomenon has been reported for the humerus in some species (Lee, Muscle moment arms were simulated using a simplified humerus with all hypothetical muscles inserting at the same point in order to assess the effects of different pectoral girdle geometries independent of other factors. As Emerson (

Modularity and phylogenetic signal The observed differences in the relative impact of the considered factors (phylogeny, size, locomotion) on the shape of the distinct pectoral girdle bones might indicate some modularity within the pectoral girdle of anurans.

10.1002_ece3.961,"Soil nutrient availability, invasive plants, and insect presence can directly alter ecosystem structure and function, but less is known about how these factors may interact. In this 6-year study in an old-field ecosystem, we manipulated insect abundance (reduced and control), the propagule pressure of an invasive nitrogen-fixing plant (propagules added and control), and soil nutrient availability (nitrogen added, nitrogen reduced and control) in a fully crossed, completely randomized plot design. We found that nutrient amendment and, occasionally, insect abundance interacted with the propagule pressure of an invasive plant to alter above-and belowground structure and function at our site. Not surprisingly, nutrient amendment had a direct effect on aboveground biomass and soil nutrient mineralization. The introduction of invasive nitrogen-fixing plant propagules interacted with nutrient amendment and insect presence to alter soil bacterial abundance and the activity of the microbial community. While the larger-scale, longer-term bulk measurements such as biomass production and nutrient mineralization responded to the direct effects of our treatments, the shorter-term and dynamic microbial communities tended to respond to interactions among our treatments. Our results indicate that soil nutrients, invasive plants, and insect herbivores determine both above-and belowground responses, but whether such effects are independent versus interdependent varies with scale.","Introduction Decades of research demonstrate that soil nutrient availability, invasive plants, and insect abundance can alter the structure of aboveground communities (Mack et al. Although the above-and belowground compartments of ecosystems are often linked (Wardle et al. Few studies, to our knowledge, have examined how these three key drivers of plant community structure and ecosystem function – invasive plant species, aboveground insects, and soil nutrient availability – interact to shape both above-and belowground community structure, function, and associated ecosystem processes. In this study, we examined the main and interactive effects of these drivers on above-and belowground community structure and ecosystem function after 6 years of experimentally manipulating the abundance of invasive plant propagules entering the system (at two levels), insect presence (at two levels), and soil nitrogen availability (at three levels) in an old-field ecosystem in the eastern United States. Previous work at this site found that soil nutrient availability interacted with propagule supply to alter the production of an invasive nitrogen-fixing plant (Sanders et al.

Methods In 2004, we established a multifactor experiment in an intact old field located on the Oak Ridge National Environmental Research Park, Tennessee (35°58′N 84°17′W). The site was abandoned from agricultural use in 1943 and has been managed since 2003 with an annual mowing regime. Soil at the site is Typic Hapludult, which has a silty clay-loam texture, is slightly acidic, and drains moderately well (Phillips et al. Verbesina occidentalis , Verbesina virginica , and Solidago altissima , make up ∼40% of the plant biomass, and there are approximately 60 other subdominant herbaceous, graminoid, and woody native and exotic species, including Lespedeza cuneata (Sanders et al. n = 6 for each treatment combination). The experimental field site located near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. We manipulated the density of invasive plant propagules, insect abundance, and soil nutrient availability in a fully crossed, completely randomized design. From 2004 to 2006, we manipulated the propagules of an invasive nitrogen-fixing plant, Lespedeza cuneata , by adding 1700 seeds·m −2 with a seed spreader to 36 randomly selected plots (Ernst Conservation Seeds, Meadville, PA). The density of L. cuneata , a Rank 1 invasive species, was ∼6 × higher in the seed addition plots than in nonaddition plots (Sanders et al. From 2004 to 2009, we manipulated insect presence and absence by applying permethrin insecticide (Hi-Yield Kill-A-Bug, Voluntary Purchasing Group, Bonham, TX) to 36 randomly selected plots. Using a backpack sprayer, 0.23 L·m −2 of insecticide was added every 2–3 weeks to insect-removal plots during the growing season. Permethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid-based insecticide, is widely used in ecological studies (e.g., Root −2 ) relative to the control plots (28.4 individuals m −2 ; Sanders et al. 3 -N and NH 4 -N in the soil solution differed between insect-reduced and control plots (Sanders et al. From 2004 to 2009, we manipulated soil nutrient availability by doing nothing (control), adding nitrogen to increase nitrogen availability, and adding carbon to reduce nitrogen availability. Nitrogen was added as urea fertilizer (20 g·m −2 ·year −1 ), and carbon was applied as sucrose (167 g·m −2 ·year −1 ) (Sanders et al. 3 -N + NH 4 -N) was 2 × higher in nitrogen-added plots and 5 × lower in carbon-added plots ( P < 0.0001; Sanders et al. 3 -N and NH 4 -N availability ( P < 0.0001), whereas carbon fertilization decreased NO 3 -N availability ( P < 0.0001) but had no effect on NH 4 -N availability ( P = 0.50; Blue et al. To assess how the plant community responded to the treatments, we harvested aboveground plant biomass at the end of the growing season in 2009. We randomly placed a 0.5 m × 1 m quadrat near the center of each of the 72 plots and clipped all of the aboveground plant biomass to ground level. We separated Lespedeza from the biomass of other species; biomass was oven-dried for approximately 48 h at 60°C and weighed. To assess the structure and function of the soil community and the soil properties that might influence it, we collected two sets of soil samples (0–10 cm depth, 5 cm diameter) randomly from each plot in July, 2009. Soils collected for molecular analysis (∼15 g) were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis. Soil samples for other analyses were returned to the laboratory, homogenized by plot, and sieved to 2 mm. We measured the gravimetric water content (GWC) on each plots sample by oven drying ∼20 g of soil at 105°C for ∼48 h. We measured pH on ∼10 g of dry soil with 0.01 mol L −1 CaCl 2 (Robertson et al. Bacterial and fungal relative abundance (gene copy number) were measured using qPCR (see Castro et al. μ L of SYBR green master mix (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California), 5 μ mol of the corresponding primer (Eurofins mwg operon Huntsville, Alabama), and 1 μ L of DNA diluted 1:10 with sterile water. All reactions were brought to a final volume of 30 μ L with sterile water. Amplification protocol for the 16S rRNA gene consisted of an initial denaturing cycle of 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 53°C for 15 sec, and 72°C for 1 min. Amplification for the18S rRNA gene consisted of an initial denaturing cycle of 95°C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 53°C for 15 sec, and 70°C for 30 sec. We conducted a melting curve analysis on the products upon completion of the PCR cycle to ensure the purity of the amplification product. We measured fluorescence of the products after each cycle using a 96-well Chromo 4 thermocycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories). We present all data as gene copy number per gram of dry soil (Strickland and Rousk We assayed microbial activity and function within 48 h of sample collection using methylumbelliferone (MUB)-linked substrates for three soil enzymes important in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus degradation: β -glucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase (nagase), and phosphatase, respectively. Sample suspensions were prepared by adding ∼1 g of soil to 125 mL of 50 mmol L −1 , pH 5.0, sodium acetate buffer. Soil suspensions were mixed on a stir plate for 2 min, while 96-well plates were prepared with blank wells, substrate controls, soil negative controls, reference standards, and quench controls. All plates were incubated at room temperature in the dark. Nagase and phosphatase reactions were incubated for 0.5 h, while the ß-glucosidase reaction was incubated for 2 h (Saiya-Cork et al. μ L of 0.5 mol L −1 sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Fluorescence was measured using a Modulus fluorometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA) at an excitation of 365 nm and an emission of 450 nm. Potential enzymatic activity was reported as nmol·h −1 ·g −1 . Potential soil nitrogen mineralization, nitrification, and ammonification were measured using laboratory incubations (Robertson et al. −1 KCL. Another sample was incubated at laboratory temperatures in dark 1-quart Mason jars. Each chamber contained a soil sample and a small vial of water to maintain humidity, and each chamber was flushed with air every 3–7 days. After 28 days, we removed the soils from the incubation and extracted them with 2 mol L −1 KCL. Extracts were analyzed for NO 3 -N and NH 4 -N on a Westco Smart Chem Auto Analyzer (Westco Scientific, Brookfield, CT). Initial inorganic nitrogen pools were subtracted from the incubated pools to estimate potential nitrogen mineralization. For each response variable, we analyzed the main and interactive effects of invasive plants, insect presence, and soil nutrient availability using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data were log-transformed when they violated the assumptions of ANOVA, but data shown in the text and figures are untransformed means. We used Tukey's HSD means separation test ( α = 0.05) to identify whether treatment means differed from one another when necessary.

Discussion Ecosystem leftacteristics such as nutrient status and insect presence may interact with the presence or abundance of invasive plants to alter ecosystem structure and function. Our study found that nutrient status and, occasionally, insect abundance interacted with the propagule pressure of an invasive plant to alter the above-and belowground structure and function of an old-field ecosystem. Not surprisingly and as predicted, nutrient amendment had a direct effect on aboveground biomass and soil nutrient mineralization; however, the introduction of Lespedeza propagules interacted with nutrient amendment and to a lesser extent insect abundance to alter soil bacterial abundance and the function of the microbial community. Thus, the larger-scale more integrative measures of biomass production and nutrient mineralization appear to be coupled and respond to direct effects of our treatments, while the microbial community, with more rapid turnover times, responds to interactions among our treatments. As is often the case in other experiments, nutrient availability controlled both aboveground biomass and soil nutrient mineralization in our experiment but in different directions (Vitousek et al. Nitrogen reduction decreased aboveground biomass (e.g., carbon input) relative to unamended and nitrogen-added plots, which did not differ from each other. This pattern, where nitrogen addition did not alter aboveground biomass production, was consistent even when we removed Lespedeza biomass from our analysis, indicating that nitrogen reduction lowers production relative to nitrogen addition in control plots irrespective of invasion by Lespedeza. Nutrient reduction at our site also reduced belowground root biomass, indicating that when nutrients were low, plant carbon allocation to the soil and the microbial community which lived there was also low (Blue et al. Bacterial abundance was higher when Lespedeza propagules were added to control plots, but lower when propagules were added to plots where nitrogen was reduced. When nitrogen was added, there was no effect of propagule addition on bacterial abundance. These results suggest that in control plots, which were more productive with greater plant inputs than nitrogen-reduced plots, the introduction of nitrogen-fixing Lespedeza propagules reduced nutrient constraints on the bacterial community, thereby increasing bacterial abundance. Since an increase in nitrogen-fixer abundance can alleviate nitrogen constraints on ecosystems, bacterial abundance might also increase (Selmants et al. Shifts in plant species composition can change carbon allocation to the rhizosphere community leading to shifts in microbial community abundance and composition (Wardle et al. Insects, specifically herbivores, can alter plant inputs into soil communities via their direct impact on plant function (e.g., secondary chemistry and reduced biomass) or by causing a shift in plant community composition (Hillebrand et al. While bacterial responses differed among treatments in our experiment, fungal responses did not. In spite of a number of studies showing strong responses of fungi to plant invasion (Van Der Putten et al. Changes in bacterial and fungal abundance can indicate that biomass of the community was changing in response to experimental manipulations, but activity and function of that community might not change in tandem (Sinsabaugh et al. β -glucosidase) or play a key role in soil nitrogen and phosphorus cycling (nagase and phosphatase) (Sinsabaugh et al. β -Glucosidase and nagase activity were higher when propagules of Lespedeza were added to plots where nutrients were reduced, but activities of both enzymes were lower in plots where propagules of Lespedeza were added to plots where nutrients were not manipulated. While there was no statistical interaction between propagule pressure and nutrient amendment on phosphatase activity, the patterns were similar to the other enzymes. The addition of an invasive nitrogen-fixing plant appears to ameliorate the impact of nutrient reduction on soil microbial function. Nitrogen fixation by an invasive plant may have altered the way microbial communities access nutrients in low-nutrient environments, even though this effect did not scale up to alter potential nitrogen mineralization. Similar to our results, Kardol et al. ( Our results indicate that propagule pressure from an invasive nitrogen-fixing plant can interact with soil nutrient status and insect abundance to shape plant and soil communities and potentially the feedbacks between the two. After 6 years of experimental treatments, our larger-scale measurements – plant biomass and soil nitrogen cycling – responded directly to the main effects of our manipulations, while the more fine-scale community measurements tended to be shaped by interactive effects of our treatments, in particular invasive species and nutrient manipulations. Plant–microbe interactions run the gamut from positive interactions that enhance plant growth to negative interactions that slow plant growth (Jackson and Taylor"
10.1002_ece3.9627,"Abstract Predator–prey dynamics are a fundamental part of ecology, but directly studying interactions has proven difficult. The proliferation of camera trapping has enabled the collection of large datasets on wildlife, but researchers face hurdles inferring interactions from observational data. Recent advances in hierarchical co‐abundance models infer species interactions while accounting for two species' detection probabilities, shared responses to environmental covariates, and propagate uncertainty throughout the entire modeling process. However, current approaches remain unsuitable for interacting species whose natural densities differ by an order of magnitude and have contrasting detection probabilities, such as predator–prey interactions, which introduce zero inflation and overdispersion in count histories. Here, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical N‐mixture co‐abundance model that is suitable for inferring predator–prey interactions. We accounted for excessive zeros in count histories using an informed zero‐inflated Poisson distribution in the abundance formula and accounted for overdispersion in count histories by including a random effect per sampling unit and sampling occasion in the detection probability formula. We demonstrate that models with these modifications outperform alternative approaches, improve model goodness‐of‐fit, and overcome parameter convergence failures. We highlight its utility using 20 camera trapping datasets from 10 tropical forest landscapes in Southeast Asia and estimate four predator–prey relationships between tigers, clouded leopards, and muntjac and sambar deer. Tigers had a negative effect on muntjac abundance, providing support for top‐down regulation, while clouded leopards had a positive effect on muntjac and sambar deer, likely driven by shared responses to unmodelled covariates like hunting. This Bayesian co‐abundance modeling approach to quantify predator–prey relationships is widely applicable across species, ecosystems, and sampling approaches and may be useful in forecasting cascading impacts following widespread predator declines. Taken together, this approach facilitates a nuanced and mechanistic understanding of food‐web ecology.","INTRODUCTION Understanding predator–prey interactions is a foundational theme in ecology (Lotka, Hypothetical predator–prey co‐abundance relationships. (a) A positive predator–prey relationship suggests top‐down regulation via predation is not the dominant factor shaping abundances. This may arise where there is strong bottom‐up regulation of both prey and predators or severe disturbances affecting both species. (b) The lack of a predator–prey relationship could arise due to a lack of interactions, such as if predator dietary preferences exclude a specific prey species or each species utilizes different habitats. (c) A negative predator–prey relationship could arise from strong top‐down regulation via predation that regulates prey abundance. Similarly, a negative predator–prey relationship suggests predator extirpation may allow prey to increase, termed “trophic release”. Ecologists have frequently used observational methods to study predation by comparing landscapes that vary in predator and prey densities (e.g., Atkins et al., Many ecological sampling methods produce multispecies detection histories (i.e., binary detections or nondetections per sampling location and sampling occasion) or count histories (i.e., number of individuals counted per sampling location and sampling occasion), including point counts, camera trapping, and acoustic sampling. Detection and count histories can capture the spatiotemporal patterns of species observed across a landscape and have been used to study habitat associations, species distributions, and population dynamics (Kéry & Royle, Co‐abundance models that use count data instead of occurrence data to infer species interactions have solved many of the issues raised by Blanchet et al. ( Problems and solutions for inferring species interactions from observational data, such as camera trapping capture histories. Problems inferring predator–prey interactions Solutions Occurrence data (i.e., presence and absence) lacks enough information to infer biotic interactions (Blanchet et al., Camera trapping can obtain count data (i.e., number of individuals per independent capture) and N‐mixture models utilize count data in a count history matrix to estimate abundance while accounting for imperfect detection (Royle, Need to propagate uncertainty throughout the entire modeling process (Brodie & Giordano, Use integrated co‐abundance model where all parameters are estimated in a single set of simulations using Bayesian Markov chain Mote Carlo (MCMC) methods (Brodie et al., Species occurrence and abundance depend on the environment (i.e., habitat filtering) and the joint habitat preferences of two species could falsely create the illusion of interactions (Blanchet et al., Integrate environmental covariates affecting both species into the co‐abundance modeling framework (Brodie et al., Sampling scale influences measures of co‐occurrence. Spatial scale must be fine scale enough to detect interactions between individuals, while also encompassing broad variation in species' distributions (Blanchet et al., Spatially resample camera trap locations to reflect the study species' home ranges that ensure detections are spatially independent and comparable across camera trapping sessions (Rayan & Linkie, Appropriate statistical inference requires a very large sample size (Blanchet et al., Technological and cost improvements have made it possible to conduct large, standardized, and repeated camera trapping sessions that can collectively generate sufficient sample sizes, even for rare and cryptic species. For example, in our case study below, we used data from 1210 camera traps from 20 sessions conducted across 10 landscapes that generated 5980 independent captures of our four study species Strong interactions may lead to complete species exclusions and adding zeros to count histories usually leads to deviations from the normal Poisson distribution (Blanchet et al., Incorporate species absences in count histories and classify zeros as true or false zeros (Blasco‐Moreno et al., Positive correlations between predator and prey abundances are difficult to interpret in terms of interspecific interactions (Brodie et al., Interpret negative predator–prey relationships as evidence that predation is regulating the focal prey population(s) (Ripple et al., N‐mixture models are sensitive to model assumption violations that can inflate absolute density estimates leading to inaccurate inferences for determining population size (Link et al., Interpret results from co‐abundance models as the directional change in species abundance relative to covariates and not as absolute population sizes (Gilbert et al.,  Note : This manuscript describes an approach to implement all solutions. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical N‐mixture co‐abundance model to study predator–prey interactions while conforming to the criteria proposed by Blanchet et al. ( Panthera tigris ) or clouded leopards ( Neofelis nebulosa and N. diardi ) suppress sambar deer ( Rusa unicolor ) or muntjac deer ( Muntiacus muntjac ).

MATERIALS AND METHODS A two‐species N‐mixture model Our approach was to test for the effect of a dominant predator's local abundance on a subordinate prey's local abundance using count histories. We adapted the N‐mixture co‐abundance modeling framework from Brodie et al. ( i (either dominant dom or subordinate sub ) at sampling unit j , denoted as N   , through repeated counts of the population over a time frame during which the population is closed to change (Royle, i,j   and model the expected count of species  N i , j ∼ Poisson λ i , j i at sampling unit j , λ  , relative to covariates using a log‐link function (Royle, i,j  i at sampling unit j , Z  as a random Bernoulli trial and multiply the expected count of species i,j  i at sampling unit j , λ   , by i,j  Z   (Blasco‐Moreno et al., i,j  i at sampling unit j , Z   based on our observational camera trapping data where i,j  Z   was 1 if the sampling unit was in a landscape where the species was detected, and ij  Z   was 0 in the event the species was never detected and existing literature corroborated their extirpation (Amir et al., ij   Fixing local abundance to zero rather than estimating nonzero abundance where the species was extirpated minimizes the chances of making a type I error (Martin et al.,  N i , j ∼ Poisson λ i , j * Z ij The effect of the covariates and the dominant on the subordinate species was modeled as:  where α  log λ sub , j = α sub * covariates j + δ * N dom , j sub is a vector of environmental covariate effects for the subordinate and δ represents the effect of the latent abundance per sampling unit of the dominant species ( N  dom, ) on the subordinate. An estimated value of j  δ < 0 would infer a negative co‐abundance relationship between the dominant and subordinate species in support of a predatory interaction (e.g., top‐down regulation; Figure δ > 0 would infer a positive predator–prey co‐abundance relationship that is likely driven by responses to unmodelled covariates (e.g., food availability to prey that underlies bottom‐up regulation, Figure δ with 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CI) overlapping zero do not indicate biologically meaningful interactions (Figure δ * N  dom, . j  We assume that we imperfectly observed the latent abundance of both species during sampling, thus giving rise to false zeros in our count histories (Blasco‐Moreno et al., N   by assuming that the detections of species i,j  i at sampling unit j during sampling occasion k , denoted as n   , follow a binomial distribution with species‐level detection probability i,j,k  p   : i,j,k   We modeled the detection probability of species  n i , j , k ∼ Binomial N i , j , k , p i , j , k i at sampling unit j during sampling occasion k , p   , relative to covariates using a logit‐link function (Royle, i,j,k   (Kéry & Royle, i,j,k   where  ε i , j , k ∼ Normal 0 , τ i τ   was the standard deviation of the ODRE.

We conducted 20 camera trapping sessions in ten lowland primary tropical forest landscapes in Sumatra (3), Borneo (2), Singapore (1), Peninsular Malaysia (2), and Thailand (2) (Table 2 . We standardized camera deployment between landscapes using either Reconyx or Bushnell cameras attached to trees at 0.2–0.3 m height and placed along natural wildlife trails without baits (Jansen et al., We systematically deployed camera traps in each landscape in a grid format and then spatially resampled the camera traps into 7.8 km 2 hexagonal sampling units due to unequal camera spacing between large continuous forests (>1 km between cameras) and small forest fragments (<500 m between cameras). Resampling all camera traps into spatially standardized sampling units ensures comparability among landscapes, prevents spatial pseudo‐replication, and ensures that we are estimating abundance as opposed to habitat use (Rayan & Linkie, Study species Tigers ( Panthera tigris ) are the largest carnivores distributed across Southeast Asia, and clouded leopards ( Neofelis nebulosa and N. diardi , analyzed as one species) are large carnivores that co‐occur with tigers across mainland Southeast Asia and Sumatra but are the largest carnivores in Borneo where tigers are no longer native (Phillipps & Phillipps, Rusa unicolor ) and muntjac deer ( Muntiacus muntjak ) deer are common large ungulates widely distributed through our study region. For gregarious muntjac deer (20+ individuals per sampling occasion), we followed Brodie et al. ( Covariates While there are many factors that affect species abundance, our analysis focused on a limited set of powerful composite variables. To account for environmental and anthropogenic disturbances that may affect species abundance, we included the Forest Landscape Integrity Index (FLII) and Human Footprint Index (HFP) as fixed effect covariates on the abundance formula for both species. The FLII is a globally continuous measure of the world's forests that integrates both observed deforestation and inferred edge effects and the loss of connectivity (Grantham et al., r | < 0.5). The abundance formula modeled the expected count relative to environmental covariates for species i at sampling unit j as follows:  The abundance model for the subordinate included an additional parameter estimating the effect of the latent abundance of the dominant species:  log λ i , j = α0 i + α1 i * FLII j + α2 i * HFP j + α3 i * Landscape j δ * N  dom, .

DISCUSSION We introduced a two‐species N‐mixture modeling approach to quantify predator–prey relationships from observational count histories, while accounting for shared responses to the environment and propagating uncertainty throughout the modeling process. We assessed how this model performed using camera trapping data of two Asian apex predators and two of their key prey species that exhibit contrasting detection probabilities and natural densities. We found that explicitly classifying both the source of true zeros with the iZIP distribution in the abundance formula and false zeros with our detection formula containing the ODRE were necessary to infer ecologically meaningful predator–prey interactions while ensuring parameter convergence across all species pairs (Blasco‐Moreno et al., There is a strong appetite to infer species interactions from camera trap data and to overcome the limitations of traditional co‐occurrence models (Blanchet et al., Predator losses in temperate ecosystems often lead to trophic release, where a subset of prey species increase in abundance (Ripple et al., This modeling framework is widely applicable across species, ecosystems, and sampling approaches (acoustic monitoring, camera trapping, and point counts) that produce count histories. A key improvement of our co‐abundance modeling approach that classifies the source of zeros in count histories is to move trophic cascades research past binary comparisons of landscapes based on predator presence or absence (e.g., Atkins et al.,

CONCLUSION Our study provides ecologists with a modeling approach to infer predatory interactions from observationally collected count data across multiple landscapes. This remarkably flexible approach opens novel opportunities to evaluate species interactions across natural or disturbance gradients, including when species abundances vary or where some sites experienced extirpations. There is direct applicability to ongoing predator conservation and trophic cascades research as our study species continue to experience range contractions. We look forward to opportunities to ground truth the results from our approach by co‐locating camera trapping studies with manipulative experiments (e.g., predator reintroductions) and direct predation observations.

10.1002_ejoc.202000916,We herein report an ammonium salt‐catalyzed protocol for the regioselective ring opening of aryl‐aziridines with β‐keto esters. The reaction gives access to a variety of highly functionalized target molecules with two consecutive stereogenic centers and can be rendered enantioselective (up to e.r . = 91:9) by using bifunctional chiral ammonium salt catalysts.,"Introduction Aziridines have been established as interesting building blocks for a variety of (asymmetric) transformations and their synthetic versatility can be attributed to the fact that they easily undergo ring opening reactions with a variety of different nucleophiles General reactivity of aziridines towards nucleophilic attack (A), our recently developed asymmetric α‐hydroxylation of β‐keto esters 1 with oxaziridines 2 (B), and the herein investigated addition of compounds 1 to aryl‐aziridines 4 (C). John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Our group has a strong interest in asymmetric ion pairing catalysis A ) can be used for the asymmetric α‐hydroxylation of β‐keto esters 1 by using racemic oxaziridines 2 as the O‐transfer reagents (accompanied by a simultaneous resolution of the oxaziridines 2 as outlined in Scheme A ) may also facilitate the addition of pronucleophiles 1 to aryl‐aziridines 4 . In general, the asymmetric ring‐opening of aziridines with β‐keto esters 1 using chiral ammonium salt catalysts has been well‐investigated, i.e. by the groups of Dixon and Jørgenson. 4 were used and to the best of our knowledge there are only very few reports in general, where enolate precursors were added to such aziridines in an asymmetric manner. 1 to (racemic) aziridines 4 , which would result in the formation of the highly functionalized target molecules 5 (Scheme

Results and Discussion We started our investigations by carrying out the reaction between the tert ‐butyl ester 1a and the phenyl aziridine 4a . The reason why we opted for the N ‐tosyl protected 4a was because we previously (during the hydroxylation of 1 with oxaziridines 2 ) realized that sulfonamide groups provide a very good point of coordination for our bifunctional ammonium salts A . A  B  C  D . First experiments without any catalyst (entry 1) and in the presence of a simple achiral ammonium salt (entry 2) clearly proved the beneficial effect of the phase‐transfer catalyst and showed that the reaction proceeds via addition to the benzylic carbon of the aziridine (giving 5a ). The relative configuration of the major diastereomer of product 5a was assigned by single‐crystal X‐ray analysis unlike diastereomer was found to be the main product. We then carried out a first base screening with our urea‐containing catalyst A1 (entries 3–6) and found that the targeted product 5a could be obtained in a reasonable yield of 79 % and with promising enantio‐ and diastereoselectivities ( d.r . = 6:1; e.r . = 89:11) after 24 h when using two equivalents of solid Cs 2 CO 3 (entry 6). The use of aqueous bases on the other hand significantly slowed down the conversion (entry 4) and stronger bases (e.g. NaOH) were found to be not suited at all (results not given in the table ), i.e. as the aziridine decomposed significantly under these conditions. Interestingly, while the major diastereomer could be obtained with a good enantiomeric ratio of 89:11, the minor diastereomer was formed in an almost racemic manner (entry 6). We then tested other derivatives of the bifunctional ammonium salts A (entries 7–9 give three representative examples), but neither the use of a thiourea (entry 7), nor using sterically more bulky systems (entry 9) resulted in any improvement. When using the well‐established Maruoka catalyst B next (entry 10), d.r . = 1.5:1). In sharp contrast to ammonium salt A1 however, catalyst B allowed for higher enantioselectivities of the minor diastereomer (favoring the same major enantiomers of both diastereomers as A1 ). The classical Cinchona alkaloid ammonium salts C were found to be less suited for this reaction (entries 11 and 12), while the bifunctional catalyst D  A . Based on these results, which support a beneficial effect of the bifunctional nature of the catalyst, we then tried to further optimize the reaction conditions using A1 (entries 14–18). While non‐aromatic solvents were found to be less suited (entries 14, 15), the use of a lower amount of base resulted in a slightly increased enantioselectivity of 91:9 (compare entries 16 and 6). However, the yield was noticeable lower, and we found that actually this reaction stalled after around 60 % conversion, requiring addition of more base to proceed to completion. When carrying out the reaction under more concentrated conditions, the yield improved slightly, while the enantioselectivity decreased (entry 17). This result is in line with our recent observations for the α‐hydroxylation of compounds 1 , where higher dilution was beneficial for high enantioselectivities as well. Unfortunately, during these optimization attempts we observed a very strong influence of the starting material quality on the stereoselectivity of the reaction. First, the aziridine 4 has to be rather clean and especially even very minor quantities of iodine residues originating from the synthesis route e.r . In addition, the used β‐keto ester 1 has to be “perfectly clean” as well, as we observed that batches of 1a that contained very small quantities of unidentified impurities (less than 1 % by 1 H NMR) resulted in reduced enantioselectivities down to e.r . = 75:25 under otherwise identical conditions (in addition the yields were a bit higher here, demonstrating the notable influence of these unknown impurities on the reaction performance). Thus, use tests of each batch of the starting materials had to be made during all these optimizations. In sharp contrast to this pronounced sensitivity on the starting material quality observed for the synthesis of 5 , use tests of different keto ester 1a batches for other reactions catalyzed by catalysts A (like the above mentioned α‐hydroxylation 1a and/or 4a reproducible results were obtained when repeating the experiments several times.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd During our A1 ‐catalyzed α‐hydroxylation of 1 with oxaziridines 2 we also observed a practical simultaneous kinetic resolution of compounds 2 (up to s = 45) 4a too. We thus carried out the addition of 1a to rac ‐ 4a (2 equiv.) under the optimized conditions (entry 16, Table 4a as well [ e.r . = 60:40 for ( S )‐ 4a after 25 % conversion; s = 4.8]. Giving the significantly lower stereoselectivity in the synthesis of 5a compared to our previous synthesis of 3 , this lower efficiency for the simultaneous resolution of 4a comes as no surprise, but nevertheless this result supports our initial hypothesis. To gather further information about this aziridine‐opening reaction, we next carried out the addition of 1a to enantiopure ( R )‐ 4a  R,R )‐ A1 or ( S,S )‐ A1 as a catalyst (Scheme Match/mismatch scenario in the addition of 1a to ( R )‐ 4a in the presence of both enantiomers of the catalyst A1 and the proposed match‐transition state.

On the other hand, the reaction with the ( S,S )‐catalyst proceeded significantly slower and with much lower diastereoselectivity (mismatch case). In our previous investigations on the use of catalysts A for reactions of β‐keto esters 1 we observed that the ( S,S )‐catalyst enantiomers always favor Re ‐face addition of the nucleophile. A1 ‐catalyzed α‐hydroxylation of 1a with 2 support a transition state where the enolate is H‐bonded to the urea moiety, while the electrophile is coordinated to the ammonium group. 4a , and the unambiguously determined relative configuration of 4a , R,R )‐catalyst is supposed to interact with both starting materials 1a and 4a in an organized bifunctional manner as illustrated in Scheme S,R )‐ 5a . Based on this model it can also be proposed that the slightly preferred enantiomer of the minor like diastereomer is ( S,S )‐ 5a . Summing these investigations up, it was demonstrated that the stereoselective addition of pronucleophile 1a to aziridine 4a can be controlled by using the bifunctional ammonium salts A . Unfortunately however, because of the unexpected pronounced sensitivity that we observed during all these test reactions, and despite the promising selectivities up to e.r . = 91:9, this reaction as such is far from being as robust and practical as other chiral ammonium salt catalyzed reactions that we investigated recently. Considering the novelty of the products 5 that are accessible by this strategy in general, but keeping in mind the practical limitations of the asymmetric protocol, i.e. the sensitivity to the starting material qualities, we thus investigated the application scope for the racemic phase transfer‐catalyzed addition of various β‐keto esters 1 to aryl‐aziridines 4 only. As shown in Scheme 1 and acceptors 4 were reacted for three days in the presence of benzyltriethylammonium chloride (TEBAC) using Cs 2 CO 3 (a) or K 3 PO 4 (b) as the base. Interestingly, mesylated aziridines did not react well (see the result given for product 5b ) and when using N ‐Boc aziridines no reaction was observed at all. On the other hand, the use of methyl or benzyl esters revealed a strong influence of this group on the overall outcome, as both of them resulted in the direct formation of the spirocyclic γ‐lactam 6 upon addition to aziridine 4a . Different substituents on the donor side were tolerated (see products 5e – i ), although in some of these cases the use of K 3 PO 4 was found to be beneficial over Cs 2 CO 3 (in the latter case significant amounts of decomposition products were observed). On the other hand, variations of the acceptor aryl group were generally well accepted in the 4‐position, independent of the nature of the base, while the 3‐position was lower yielding (see product 55 ) and in this case again significant amounts of unidentified decomposition products were formed. Nevertheless, the racemic protocol generally gives access to a variety of differently functionalized products 5 with relatively good yields and reasonable diastereoselectivities under these operationally simple ammonium salt‐catalyzed conditions.

Conclusions Summing these investigations up, we have shown that β‐keto esters 1 react with aryl‐aziridines 4 under (chiral) ammonium salt catalysis giving access to highly functionalized products 5 . In principle a catalytic and reasonably enantioselective protocol could be developed by using the bifunctional ammonium salt catalysts A . Unfortunately, however, this reaction was found to be very sensitive towards the quality of the starting materials. Nevertheless, control experiments showed a pronounced match/mismatch behavior of the bifunctional catalyst and the used aziridine, thus pointing towards a mechanism where the catalyst simultaneously activates both of the reaction partners.

Experimental Section General experimental and analytical details as well as the characterization data of all the novel compounds can be found in the online supporting information.  Racemic Protocol: A mixture of 0.1 mmol β‐keto ester 1 (1 equiv.), 2.2 mg of TEBAC (0.01 mmol, 10 mol‐%) and 0.2 mmol base (2 equiv.) was dissolved in 5 mL of toluene (Ar‐atmosphere). Then 0.2 mmol of aziridine 4 (2 equiv.) were added in one portion. After a reaction time of three days the mixture was filtered through a plug of Na 2 SO 4 and washed with DCM. The crude product, obtained after evaporation of the solvent, was subjected to column chromatography (silica gel, heptanes:EtOAc = 5:1) to isolate products 5 and 6 as mixtures of diastereomers. The diastereomers were in some cases separated using preparative HPLC (Grace Alltima Silica 10 µm 250 × 10 mm, n ‐hexane/EtOAc, 5 mL/min).  Enantioselective Screening Protocol: A mixture of the β‐keto ester 1a (0.1 mmol, 1 equiv.), catalyst A1 (7.6 mg, 0.01 mmol, 10 mol‐%) and 0.2 mmol of the tested base (2 equiv.) were dissolved in 5 mL of the given solvent (argon atmosphere, room temperature). Then 48 mg of 2‐phenyltosylaziridine 4a (0.2 mmol, 2 equiv.) were added in one portion. After a reaction time of one day the mixture was filtered through a plug of Na 2 SO 4 and washed with DCM. The crude product, obtained after evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure, was then subjected to column chromatography purification (silica gel, heptanes:EtOAc = 2:1) to isolate product 5a as a mixture of two diastereomers ( d.r . up to 8:1) in yields up to 84 %. The diastereomers were separated using preparative HPLC (Grace Alltima Silica 10 µm 250 × 10 mm, n ‐hexane/EtOAc = 9:1, 5 mL/min, retention times: 39.1 min major, 46.8 min minor). The enantiomeric excess of the minor diastereomer was determined by HPLC using a YMC Amylose SA column ( n ‐hexane/ i PrOH = 3:1, 1 mL/min, 10 °C, retention times: 21.0 and 35.5 min). The enantiomeric excess of the major diastereomer was determined by HPLC using a YMC Cellulose SB column ( n ‐hexane/ i PrOH = 10:1, 1 mL/min, 10 °C, retention times: 22.2 min major, 20.2 min minor).

10.1002_mp.14424,"This manuscript describes a dataset of thoracic cavity segmentations and discrete pleural effusion segmentations we have annotated on 402 computed tomography (CT) scans acquired from patients with non‐small cell lung cancer. The segmentation of these anatomic regions precedes fundamental tasks in image analysis pipelines such as lung structure segmentation, lesion detection, and radiomics feature extraction. Bilateral thoracic cavity volumes and pleural effusion volumes were manually segmented on CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive “NSCLC Radiomics” data collection. Four hundred and two thoracic segmentations were first generated automatically by a U‐Net based algorithm trained on chest CTs without cancer, manually corrected by a medical student to include the complete thoracic cavity (normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, lung hilum, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and other anatomic anomalies), and revised by a radiation oncologist or a radiologist. Seventy‐eight pleural effusions were manually segmented by a medical student and revised by a radiologist or radiation oncologist. Interobserver agreement between the radiation oncologist and radiologist corrections was acceptable. All expert‐vetted segmentations are publicly available in NIfTI format through The Cancer Imaging Archive at https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.2020.6c7y‐gq39 . Tabular data detailing clinical and technical metadata linked to segmentation cases are also available. Thoracic cavity segmentations will be valuable for developing image analysis pipelines on pathologic lungs — where current automated algorithms struggle most. In conjunction with gross tumor volume segmentations already available from “NSCLC Radiomics,” pleural effusion segmentations may be valuable for investigating radiomics profile differences between effusion and primary tumor or training algorithms to discriminate between them.","INTRODUCTION Automated or semi‐automated algorithms aimed at analyzing chest computed tomography (CT) scans typically require the creation of a three‐dimensional (3D) map of the volume‐of‐interest (VOI) as the initial step. 1  2  3  4  5  6  Preprocessing strategies to identify thoracic VOIs in the presence of pathology have been described. In 2014, Mansoor et al. presented a seminal approach that identified CTs with large volumetric differences between autosegmented lung and the thoracic cage and refined these lung segmentations using texture‐based features. 7  8  9  10  11  12  13  5  14  15  16  17  18  As methodologies to identify thoracic VOIs in pathologic lungs march forward, data to train and vet them must keep pace. Hofmanninger et al. cited a paucity of diverse data — not inferior methodologies — as the principal obstacle in pathologic lung segmentation. 19  20  10  11  We present PleThora, a dataset of ural effusion and left and right ple cic cavity segmentations delineated on 402 CT scans from The Cancer Imaging Archive thora 21  22  23 

ACQUISITION AND VALIDATION METHODS Segmentation acquisition Four hundred twenty‐two Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) chest CT datasets and 318 corresponding “RTSTRUCT” DICOM segmentations (featuring GTVs) were downloaded from the TCIA NSCLC‐Radiomics collection in January 2019. Four hundred and two CT scans were successfully converted from DICOM to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using a free executable called “dcm2niix”. 24  25  Thoracic cavity segmentation acquisition After converting each CT dataset to NIfTI format, lungs were automatically segmented by a publicly available 3D U‐Net lung segmentation algorithm 26  The medical student’s segmentations passed to at least one physician reviewer — either a radiologist or a radiation oncologist — to be vetted. As necessary, reviewers expanded or contracted the segmentations to include the target thoracic volumes. The most recent “RTSTRUCT” GTV segmentations (which were updated by the NSCLC‐Radiomics dataset authors in October 2019) were available to reviewers for reference as necessary. The thoracic cavity segmentations we make public are vetted segmentations. The thoracic cavity segmentation workflow is illustrated in Fig. Thoracic cavity volumes were segmented automatically then iteratively corrected by a medical student and at least one radiologist or radiation oncologist to include the entire hemithoraces. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ] Pleural effusion segmentation acquisition A fourth‐year medical student identified a subset of 78 CT scans with trace to massive pleural effusions. The medical student segmented effusions de novo rather than from an autosegmented prior (unlike the thoracic cavity segmentations). Spaces where primary tumor overlapped with effusion were excluded from the segmentation, and NSCLC‐Radiomics GTV segmentations determined the effusion segmentation extent (exemplified in Fig. Pleural effusion segmentations, excluding gross tumor volume, were delineated by a medical student and subsequently corrected by at least two radiologists. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ] The medical student's pleural effusion segmentations were vetted by at least two physicians and corrected as necessary. Like the thoracic cavity segmentations, the pleural effusion segmentations we make public are vetted by physicians. The pleural effusion segmentation workflow is illustrated in Fig. Computational tools Manual segmentations were delineated using ITK‐SNAP v.3.6. 27  28  Several additional computational tools transformed CT scans from DICOM to NIfTI format, autosegmented initial thoracic volumes, analyzed segmentations, and organized and visualized metadata. As previously noted, an executable named “dcm2niix” 24  26  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  Segmentation quality assessment To assess the quality of segmentations with respect to interobserver variability, volumetric (i.e., traditional) Dice similarity coefficients 36  37  32  38  39  40  41  42  43  39  Volumetric Dice similarity coefficient The DSC measures interobserver agreement and ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no agreement and 1 indicates perfect agreement. In the context of image segmentation, the DSC relates the overlap between two segmentations to their total volumes; mathematically, this is twice the shared volume divided by the sum of their total volumes. No consensus dictates what constitutes a “good” DSC because the DSC is sensitive to the volume of the target structure. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 132 notes that the contouring uncertainty of a structure can be expected to be a DSC of 0.8–0.9, while cautioning that “very large or very small structures may have different expected DSC values for contour uncertainty.” 44  45  39  Cohen’s Kappa coefficient The Cohen’s kappa (κ) coefficient measures interobserver reliability for qualitative observations with mutually exclusive classifications. We computed κ between expert reviewer segmentations by treating each voxel as a qualitative datum. We transformed the segmentations to numerical arrays where each array value assumed one of two binary values depending on whether the reviewer included the voxel as part of the target structure. κ is similar to the DSC in its computation of interobserver agreement, but also assesses a likelihood of chance agreement and penalizes accordingly. Like the DSC, κ generally ranges between 0 and 1, although a result < 0 is possible. Results >0.6 are generally considered good and greater than 0.8 are considered very good, 46  Surface Dice similarity coefficient Recognizing the limitations of the traditional DSC with respect to volume, Nikolov et al. 32  47  Hausdorff distance In contrast to the DSC, κ, and sDSC, which measure fractional overlap between segmentations, HDs are geometric distances between segmentation surfaces. Larger HDs signify worse interobserver agreement. Computing a HD requires determining the minimum distances from every point on the surface of segmentation A to every point on the surface of segmentation B, and the same from B to A, and arranging them in ascending order. We report the 95HD, which is the value at the 95th percentile of the ordered minimum distances. 95HD interobserver variability reported by the AAPM Thoracic Auto‐Segmentation Challenge was 5.17 2.73 and 6.71 ± 3.91 for left and right lung segmentations, respectively. ± 45  Average surface distance The directed ASD from segmentation A to segmentation B is the average of the minimum distances from every point in the surface of A to every point in the surface of B. The directed ASD from B to A is calculated similarly. We report a symmetric ASD value that averages the two directed ASDs. Symmetric ASD interobserver variability reported by the AAPM Thoracic Auto‐Segmentation Challenge was 1.51 0.67 and 1.87 ± 0.87 for left and right lung segmentations, respectively. ± 45  Expert reviewers Expert reviewers consisted of four radiologists and three radiation oncologists with varying years of experience (Table U tests 48  P < 0.001). The following paragraphs discuss how interobserver variability in our study compares with variability described in other studies. Seven radiologists (Rad) and radiation oncologists (RO) collaborated to review and correct 402 thoracic cavity segmentations and 78 pleural effusion segmentations delineated by a fourth‐year medical student.

All 78 pleural effusion segmentations were reviewed and as necessary corrected by two radiologists: Rad3 and Rad4. A subset of 15 pleural effusion segmentations were also reviewed and corrected by RO1. In contrast, not all 402 thoracic cavity segmentations were reviewed by two physicians. Rather, four subsets of 21 or 22 thoracic cavity segmentations were randomly selected for dual review. All members of a given subset were exclusive to that subset. [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com ] Median and minimum values for Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), surface DSC, κ, 95HD, and symmetric ASD spatial similarity metrics calculated between paired physician segmentations. The distributions for each observer pair are significantly different from one another for all metrics (paired Mann‐Whitney U test 48  P < 0.001). However, interobserver variability between pairs of physician‐vetted segmentations is generally acceptable. Median DSC, 95HD and symmetric ASD values for thoracic cavity segmentations are comparable to mean interobserver variability values reported by the 2017 AAPM Thoracic Auto‐Segmentation Challenge for lung segmentations. 45  Metric Pleural effusions Thoracic cavities RO1‐Rad3 RO1‐Rad4 Rad3‐Rad4 RO1‐RO3 Rad1‐RO3 Rad1‐Rad2 RO2‐Rad2 Conformality metrics (unitless) DSC Med 0.81 0.85 0.93 0.99 1.00 1.00 1.00 Min 0.10 a  0.26 0.20 0.96 0.91 a  0.99 0.97 sDSC Med 0.62 0.77 0.87 0.94 0.98 0.98 1.00 Min 0.20 a  0.32 0.21 0.73 a  0.82 0.94 0.88 Kappa Med 0.81 0.85 0.93 0.99 0.99 0.99 0.99 Min 0.10 a  0.26 0.20 0.96 0.90 a  0.99 0.97 Surface distance metrics (mm) 95HD Med 24.00 21.65 5.31 1.95 0.00 0.00 0.00 Max 127.83 127.80 161.48 a  11.35 55.11 a  0.98 24.82 ASD Med 1.82 2.45 0.79 0.25 0.05 0.03 0.00 Max 23.53 22.39 33.49 a  1.01 5.78 a  0.12 1.68 a Select cases with extreme spatial similarity metric values are explored visually in Fig. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd In general, thoracic cavity segmentation pairs enjoyed a good level of agreement. Gauged by DSC, 95HD, and symmetric ASD spatial similarity metrics, thoracic cavity segmentation interobserver variability was similar to reported interobserver variability for lung segmentation 45  19  min = 0.353, DSC med = 0.958, IQR = 0.041). In contrast, the DSC was never <0.9 between any pair of physician‐corrected contours, and the median DSC for each interobserver distribution approximated 0.99 (Fig. Dice similarity coefficient distributions reveal consistently strong agreement (>0.98) between paired, independently vetted radiologist and radiation oncologist thoracic cavity segmentations. Colored curves are kernel density estimates of DSC distributions. Note that Figs. wileyonlinelibrary.com ] Pleural effusion segmentation interobserver agreement was also consistent, although the distributions of conformality metrics and surface distance metrics generally suggest lower agreement than for thoracic cavity segmentations. Medians DSCs (Fig. 39  49  3 (IQR 30.31–113.7 cm 3 ) and 50.85 cm 3 (IQR 25.01–142.5 cm 3 ). These are an order of magnitude smaller than the mean pleural effusion volumes described in some pleural effusion autosegmentation methodologic studies, 40  Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) distributions indicate good agreement (>0.8) between most paired, independently vetted radiologist and radiation oncologist pleural effusion segmentations. Interpretation of this result should respect that DSC values calculated on trace pleural effusions are sensitive to variation between segmentations on the order of only a few voxels. As in Fig. wileyonlinelibrary.com ] Notwithstanding that interobserver agreement was generally very good, a few segmentation cases demonstrated markedly poorer agreement than others (Fig. A visual exploration of physician‐corrected segmentation pairs with the least interobserver agreement. Case LUNG1‐005 accounts for the worst Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), surface DSC, and κ values between any pair of pleural effusion segmentations. RO1 mistook atelectatic lung for effusion, but Rad3 and Rad4 did not. Case LUNG1‐253 accounts for the worst 95HD and symmetric ASD values between any pair of pleural effusion segmentations. Rad3 and Rad4 varied in how much trace pleural fluid they chose to segment. This exposes a weakness in our pleural effusion segmentation methodology because we did not decide at projection initiation whether or to what extent trace pleural fluid should be part of the segmentation. Case LUNG1‐026 accounts for the worst sDSC value between any pair of thoracic cavity segmentations. RO3 failed to segment the full extent of peri‐mediastinal primary gross tumor volume, right effusion, and left hilum (orange arrows). Case LUNG1‐354 accounts for the worst DSC, κ, 95HD, and symmetric ASD values between any pair of thoracic cavity segmentations. RO3 erroneously excluded a collapsed left lung.

Our thoracic cavity segmentations were reviewed by radiologists or radiation oncologists who had access to “RTSTRUCT” files from the latest collection update. However, these segmentations were first delineated by a medical student at a time when only earlier versions of the “RTSTRUCT” files were available. In contrast, pleural effusion segmentations were all delineated with input from the latest “RTSTRUCT” files.

In contrast, the DSC was never <0.9 between any pair of physician‐corrected contours, and the median DSC for each interobserver distribution approximated 0.99 (Fig. Dice similarity coefficient distributions reveal consistently strong agreement (>0.98) between paired, independently vetted radiologist and radiation oncologist thoracic cavity segmentations.

Volumetric Dice similarity coefficient The DSC measures interobserver agreement and ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no agreement and 1 indicates perfect agreement. In the context of image segmentation, the DSC relates the overlap between two segmentations to their total volumes; mathematically, this is twice the shared volume divided by the sum of their total volumes. No consensus dictates what constitutes a “good” DSC because the DSC is sensitive to the volume of the target structure. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 132 notes that the contouring uncertainty of a structure can be expected to be a DSC of 0.8–0.9, while cautioning that “very large or very small structures may have different expected DSC values for contour uncertainty.” 44  45  39 

Cohen’s Kappa coefficient The Cohen’s kappa (κ) coefficient measures interobserver reliability for qualitative observations with mutually exclusive classifications. We computed κ between expert reviewer segmentations by treating each voxel as a qualitative datum. We transformed the segmentations to numerical arrays where each array value assumed one of two binary values depending on whether the reviewer included the voxel as part of the target structure. κ is similar to the DSC in its computation of interobserver agreement, but also assesses a likelihood of chance agreement and penalizes accordingly. Like the DSC, κ generally ranges between 0 and 1, although a result < 0 is possible. Results >0.6 are generally considered good and greater than 0.8 are considered very good, 46 

Surface Dice similarity coefficient Recognizing the limitations of the traditional DSC with respect to volume, Nikolov et al. 32  47 

Hausdorff distance In contrast to the DSC, κ, and sDSC, which measure fractional overlap between segmentations, HDs are geometric distances between segmentation surfaces. Larger HDs signify worse interobserver agreement. Computing a HD requires determining the minimum distances from every point on the surface of segmentation A to every point on the surface of segmentation B, and the same from B to A, and arranging them in ascending order. We report the 95HD, which is the value at the 95th percentile of the ordered minimum distances. 95HD interobserver variability reported by the AAPM Thoracic Auto‐Segmentation Challenge was 5.17 2.73 and 6.71 ± 3.91 for left and right lung segmentations, respectively. ± 45 

Average surface distance The directed ASD from segmentation A to segmentation B is the average of the minimum distances from every point in the surface of A to every point in the surface of B. The directed ASD from B to A is calculated similarly. We report a symmetric ASD value that averages the two directed ASDs. Symmetric ASD interobserver variability reported by the AAPM Thoracic Auto‐Segmentation Challenge was 1.51 0.67 and 1.87 ± 0.87 for left and right lung segmentations, respectively. ± 45 

Expert reviewers Expert reviewers consisted of four radiologists and three radiation oncologists with varying years of experience (Table U tests 48  P < 0.001). The following paragraphs discuss how interobserver variability in our study compares with variability described in other studies.

NSCLC‐radiomics collection update The NSCLC‐Radiomics collection was updated on 10/23/2019, featuring new “RTSTRUCT” segmentations for all 422 cases, including revised GTVs in some cases. Our thoracic cavity segmentations were reviewed by radiologists or radiation oncologists who had access to “RTSTRUCT” files from the latest collection update. However, these segmentations were first delineated by a medical student at a time when only earlier versions of the “RTSTRUCT” files were available. In contrast, pleural effusion segmentations were all delineated with input from the latest “RTSTRUCT” files.

U‐Nets are common Convolutional Deep Neural Network architectures and form the basis of many deep learning algorithms for medical image segmentation. 52  53  54  55  56  CT scans were preprocessed as follows: voxel intensities were clipped to a range of [−250, 0] Hounsfield units by reassigning voxels less than −250 to −250 and greater than 0 to 0, voxels were isotropically resampled to 1.7 mm in each dimension, and scans were cropped from the image center to 256 by 256 by 128 voxels. Segmentations were likewise resampled and cropped. The models were trained using 316 of the 402 primary reviewer segmentations and tested with 86 secondary reviewer segmentations. The latter served as a test dataset because secondary and primary reviews were conducted independently. Nevertheless, because secondary and primary reviewers corrected the same template segmentation, we felt that corrected segmentations were likely to inherit similarities from the template that would bias the test dataset toward the training dataset. Therefore, we chose to exclude the 86 primary reviewer segmentations that corresponded to cases with a secondary reviewer from the training data. The model was initially trained end‐to‐end by fivefold cross validation. This permitted fine‐tuning of the hyperparameters (e.g., epochs, learning rate, batch size) without overfitting the external training set. The whole dataset split and secondary reviewer segmentations were recently made available through TCIA in an update (version 2) of the original dataset. To build the 3D U‐Net model we used the architecture described by Çiçek et al. 53  57  To build the 2D U‐Net model we used the same architecture as the 3D U‐Net but changed all 3D convolution and deconvolution operations to 2D operations. In this case, the algorithm was trained on 2D axial slices (i.e., 256 by 256 voxels) rather than whole volumes. Like the 3D model, the 2D U‐Net train/validation split was 80% train (32 256 slices) and 20% validation (8192 slices). The DSC plateaued at 60 epochs. The batch size was 64 slices, the DSC was used to evaluate loss, and the learning rate was set initially to 0.001 and adapted by the Adam optimization algorithm. 57

DISCUSSION To our knowledge, PleThora is the first public dataset of VOIs curated to capture all thoracic cavity pathologic change in patients with lung cancer, and the first public dataset of pleural effusion segmentations. The thoracic cavity segmentations are likely to be valuable to scientists and engineers who develop chest CT image processing pipelines that require robust methods to identify thoracic VOIs. We anticipate these segmentations to be a particularly useful addition to the corpus of training data for image processing pipelines, including the ones leveraging deep learning algorithms. Indeed, this project began as an effort to provide VOIs to study image feature symmetry between left and right thorax anatomy as a clinical outcomes predictor, building on previous work from our group that localized stroke cores by comparing and contrasting brain hemisphere information extracted by “symmetry‐sensitive convolutional neural networks.” 58  Our pleural effusion segmentations are likely to be useful for investigating two questions surrounding a CT or PET/CT finding of pleural effusion: (a) the prognostic significance of pleural effusion in various cancer types, 59  60  61  62  63  59  64  65  We acknowledge the limiting inconsistencies of human‐delineated segmentations, even those from trained radiologists or radiation oncologists. We also acknowledge intrinsic limitations in the metrics themselves. The DSC and κ are both artificially increased in large volumes, and the power of κ to penalize chance agreement is artificially decreased by the high number of true negatives in our segmentations (i.e., the high number of voxels that neither reviewer segmented as part of the target). We attempted to buffer this limitation by calculating and comparing sDSC values, which are less sensitive to variation in size. The 95 HD and symmetric ASD are not inflated by volume but are only snapshots of segmentations at their average (ASD) and near their worst (95HD) differences. Notwithstanding these limitations, we consider that the measures of interobserver variability obtained between radiologist and radiation oncologist reviewers justify acceptability of these segmentations for public use.

CONCLUSIONS We describe PleThora, a dataset of 402 expert‐vetted thoracic cavity segmentations, 78 expert‐vetted pleural effusion segmentations, and corresponding clinical and technical metadata made available to the public through TCIA at https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.2020.6c7y‐gq39 . 51
